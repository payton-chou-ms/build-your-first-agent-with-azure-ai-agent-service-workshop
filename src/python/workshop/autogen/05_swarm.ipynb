    "## Swarm\n",
    "`Swarm` implements a team in which agents can hand off task to other agents based on their capabilities. It is a multi-agent design pattern first introduced by OpenAI in an experimental project. The key idea is to let agent delegate tasks to other agents using a special tool call, while all agents share the same message context. This enables agents to make local decisions about task planning, rather than relying on a central orchestrator such as in `SelectorGroupChat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `Swarm` is a high-level API. If you need more, control and customization that is not supported by this API, you can take a look,\n",
    "at the [Handoff Pattern](../../core-user-guide/design-patterns/handoffs.ipynb), in the Core API documentation and implement your own version of the Swarm pattern.,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does It Work?\n",
    "At its core, the `Swarm` team is a group chat where agents take turn to generate a response. Similar to `SelectorGroupChat` and `RoundRobinGroupChat`, participant agents broadcast their responses so all agents share the same message context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the other two group chat teams, at each turn, the speaker agent is selected based on the most recent `HandoffMessage` message in the context. This naturally requires each agent in the team to be able to generate `HandoffMessage` to signal which other agents that it hands off to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `AssistantAgent`, you can set the handoffs argument to specify which agents it can hand off to. You can use `Handoff` to customize the message content and handoff behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall process can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent has the ability to generate `HandoffMessage` to signal which other agents it can hand off to. For `AssistantAgent`, this means setting the handoffs argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the team starts on a task, the first speaker agents operate on the task and make localized decision about whether to hand off and to whom.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When an agent generates a `HandoffMessage`, the receiving agent takes over the task with the same message context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The process continues until a termination condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show you two examples of how to use the `Swarm` team:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A customer support team with human-in-the-loop handoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An autonomous team for content generation."

    "\n",
    "3. The Flights Refunder processes refunds using the `refund_flight` tool when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If an agent hands off to the \"user\", the team execution will stop and wait for the user to input a response.\n",
    "\n",
