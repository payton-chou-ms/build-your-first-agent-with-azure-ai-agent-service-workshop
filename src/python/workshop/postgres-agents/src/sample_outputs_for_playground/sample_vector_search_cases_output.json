[{"id":615468,"name":"Le Vette v. Hardman Estate","opinion":"\"Morris, J.\\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\\n\u201cThat the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor\u2019s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.\u201d\\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, \u00a7 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant\u2019s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be\u2019held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\\nCrow, C. J., Parker, Fullerton, and Mount, JJ., concur.\""},{"id":1346648,"name":"Tombari v. City of Spokane","opinion":"\"Millard, J.\\nThis action was brought to recover for damages alleged to have been sustained as a result of the depositing of sewage and water into plaintiff\u2019s basement from a public sewer. The cause was tried to the court, which found that, pursuant to ordinance and regulations of defendant, plaintiff connected his property to appellant\u2019s sewer; that the sewer installation required and approved by defendant was improper; that the sewer was of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage and water conducted into it; and that, as the proximate result of defendant\u2019s negligence, plaintiff sustained damage in the amount of two hundred and ten dollars, including the expense of fifty-five dollars incurred in the construction of a manhole subsequent to the flooding of the basement. Judgment was entered accordingly. Defendant appealed.\\nIt is the position of appellant that an extraordinary storm condition deposited an unusual amount of water in the vicinity of respondent\u2019s property, thereby overtaxing the sewer system, which was reasonably adequate to care for sewage and water reasonably expected to accumulate under ordinary circumstances; and that the contributory negligence of respondent in failing to properly install a back water trap, or check valve, was the proximate cause of the damage and precludes a recovery by respondent.\\nThe facts are as follows:\\nRespondent owns a building, which was constructed in 1936, located at the northeast corner of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in the city of Spokane. In 1908, appellant installed the Perry street sewer, which is twenty inches in diameter from Seventh avenue to Ninth avenue. A sewer under Ninth avenue empties into the Perry street sewer, the diameter of which at this point is twenty-four inches.\\nIt is the duty, under an ordinance of the city of Spokane, of appellant\u2019s health officer, where there is a public sewer in any street, to compel every owner within one hundred and fifty feet of the sewer to install a sufficient drain pipe, which shall connect his property to the nearest sewer. The health officer is also authorized to issue a permit for a cesspool or septic tank on premises in a sewer district, to drain plumbing fixtures or floors too low to be drained into the public sewer; but all other fixtures or floors on the premises are required to be drained through the sewer. The basement of respondent\u2019s property was too low to properly drain to the sewer.\\nRespondent called in July, 1936, at the office of appellant\u2019s sewer inspector and superintendent and requested permission to install a cesspool on his premises at Ninth avenue and Perry street. After inspection of respondent\u2019s property, one of the officers of appellant\u2019s sewer department informed the respondent that he would be required to connect with the Perry street sewer and that he would not be permitted to install a cesspool; that is, the city sewer superintendent and the city sewer inspector knew that respondent\u2019s basement was too low to properly drain to the sewer, yet they required him to make the sewer connection, which they later inspected and approved.\\nThe basement drains and fixtures of respondent\u2019s property were, pursuant to the foregoing instructions, connected in July, 1936, to the sewer in Perry street. Neither the superintendent of sewers nor the inspector, who required respondent to use iron pipe instead of clay pipe he contemplated installing, informed respondent that a back water trap was necessary or would be required; nor does the city ordinance require the installation of a back water trap. The sewer connection was installed by a man who had constructed sewers for more than twenty-five years. Doubtless, the installation of the connection was in the usual, customary, and workmanlike manner, as it was approved in all respects by appellant\u2019s sewer inspector.\\nSince the construction of the Perry street sewer in 1908, the city\u2019s population has greatly increased and many additional house connections \u2014 eight hundred and ninety-one in 1933 \u2014 have been made to the sewer. Many of the streets sloping toward Perry street have been paved within the past few years, so that the surface waters feed into the catch basins, and the remainder of the surface water that does not run into the catch basins accumulates at the comer of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in front of respondent\u2019s property, where the street levels off and a pocket is formed at that intersection. Whenever it rains and the sewer becomes overloaded in that intersection, and often when it accumulates in the street, respondent\u2019s basement receives some of the water.\\nDuring the heavy rains in the early part of June,' 1937, respondent complained to one of appellant\u2019s commissioners concerning the flowing of water \u2014 not in great quantities \u2014 into his basement. The commissioner suggested to respondent that he install a \u201cback water trap.\u201d Respondent employed a plumber to install such a trap or check valve inside the basement. Whether the plumber did or did not advise respondent that the trap should be installed outside of the building, is not material. The plumber did advise respondent that a back water trap installed in the basement would protect the plumbing therein. There is some evidence that a back water trap installed outside the basement would not wholly prevent the backing up of sewage and water. It is clear, however, that respondent had no further serious difficulty subsequent to installation of a trap following the damage of which he now complains.\\nOn June 18, 1937, during a severe rain storm, respondent\u2019s basement was flooded by reason of the backing up of the water and sewage from the Perry street sewer. Great damage was inflicted to property three miles from respondent\u2019s property, it was testified, by the heavy rains. While there is evidence that the rainfall for the entire month of June was Very heavy, there is evidence from which it is reasonably inferable that the total rainfall for the month of June would not have overtaxed the sewer if it had functioned properly.\\nDuring the twenty-four hour period of June 18, 1937, forty-seven hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The weather bureau records disclosed that this rainfall was not unusual or excessive; that it had been exceeded many times during other twenty-four hour periods. On June 17, 1937, the day before the rainfall which it is claimed caused the flooding of respondent\u2019s basement, five hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The testimony of one of the weather bureau officials was that, so far as the rainfall on June 18th and 19th, 1937, was concerned, \u201cwe have had rainfall that was greater than that on numerous occasions in the city of Spokane.\u201d On cross-examination, he testified that the rainfall on those two days was unusually heavy; \u201c. . . it was unusual as compared to the normal.\u201d\\nThat is, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the city should reasonably have expected to occur again. Under such circumstances, if the sewers are so inadequate that they can not take care of the water, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.\\n\u201cWhatever the rule may be as to ordinary surface water or rainfalls, it is settled that a municipal corporation is not liable for damages caused by an overflow of its sewers occasioned by extraordinary rains or floods. However, although the rain doing the damage be of an extraordinary character, yet if the negligence of the city in failing to keep the sewers open concurred and contributed to the damage, then the city has been held liable. And if drains are so inadequate that they cannot take care of the water in case of an ordinary storm, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.\u201d 6 McQuillin Mun. Corp., Revised (2d ed.), 1226, \u00a7 2868.\\n\u201cIn order to give a stream or body of water the character of an extraordinary flow it is not necessary that it should be the greatest flow within memory, but its character in this respect is to be tested by comparison with the usual volume of floods ordinarily occurring. The mere fact, however, that a rainfall was unusual for the particular season in which it occurs does not relieve the municipality from liability. A municipality, as a general rule, is required to guard against such floods or heavy rains as have occasionally occurred, and which may reasonably be expected to occur again, although their occurrence may be at irregular and wide intervals of time.\u201d 43 C. J. 1137, \u00a7 1895.\\nThe respondent was compelled by ordinance to connect his property to the sewer. The sewer connection was made in the manner approved by the appellant city. While the overflow of the sewer was caused by unusual rainfall, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the appellant should reasonably have expected to occur again. The appellant failed in its duty to guard against such heavy rainfall as that which overtaxed the Perry street sewer, which, though' adequate when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity in 1937 to carry off the water.\\nThe case at bar is controlled by Boyer v. Tacoma, 156 Wash. 280, 286 Pac. 659, 70 A. L. R. 1342, in which we held that a city is hable for the flooding of property required to be connected with a sewer which, though sufficient when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage conducted into it. We there said:\\n\u201cIt is true that in other cases from this court statements have been made by way of argument which indicate that the contrary rule might be followed. See Vittucci Importing Co. v. Seattle, 72 Wash. 192, 130 Pac. 109. But the statements therein contained are not necessary to a decision of the case. The theory of all of the cases which we have examined, which hold the city liable under circumstances such as we have outlined above, seems to be that the property owner is required to connect with the sewer; that he is not permitted to dispose of his sewage in any other way than the one way provided by the city; that he has no power or authority to remove the cause, or to in any way remedy the defect from which his injury arises; that the city alone has the power and the means to remedy the defective sewer or to replace an inadequate sewer, and that no person should be required to suffer an injury caused by an agency over which he has no control and over which the city has absolute control, and that if an injury is inflicted by such an agency he should be properly compensated therefor. We think this is the better rule and is well supported by both reason and authority.\u201d\\nWoolworth Co. v. Seattle, 104 Wash. 629, 177 Pac. 664, is cited by appellant in support of its theory that there can be no recovery for damages from flooding where the loss was due to the concurrent negligence of the city in the maintenance of sewers of insufficient capacity to carry off an average rainfall and the contributory negligence of the owner in failing to keep clean and in proper repair a back water valve required by ordinance in all cellar and basement drains.\\nIn the case cited, a city ordinance required the installation of back water valves; while, in the case at bar, there was an absence of such requirement. There is no ordinance, nor is there any regulation of any department, of appellant which required the respondent to install a back water trap to protect his basement. The sewer connection was approved by appellant in all respects. The back water trap was voluntarily installed by respondent inside of his building to protect the plumbing in the basement upon the suggestion of one of appellant\u2019s commissioners when respondent complained of water coming into his basement. In spite of that precaution, he sustained damages; and even if he had installed a back water trap outside of his building, it is not improbable, under the circumstances, that he would have sustained damages.\\nError is next assigned on the allowance of the cost of fifty-five dollars for the installation of a back water trap. If appellant had required respondent to install, as it now insists he should have done, the back water trap at the time of the connection of his property to the sewer, that installation would have entailed very little expense. As appellant did not require that installation, which appellant insists would have prevented the dam\u00e1ge, respondent should not be compelled to pay that which he would not have been required to expend if it had not been for appellant\u2019s failure to perform its duty in the first place. Respondent acted in good faith and endeavored to comply with all the requirements exacted by appellant. The court correctly awarded to him the amount he expended in the installation of the back water trap.\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nSteinert, C. J., Beals, Geraghty, and Simpson, JJ., concur.\""},{"id":4938756,"name":"Stevens v. King County","opinion":"\"Donworth, J.\\nRespondents, as plaintiffs, brought this action against both the city of Seattle and Kang county to recover damages to real property caused by the invasion of surface waters. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the trial court, sitting without a jury, sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence interposed by the county and dismissed the case as to that defendant. The trial then proceeded with the city as sole defendant, and at the conclusion thereof the trial court rendered an oral decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The city\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the oral decision having been denied, the court entered findings of fact and judgment for the plaintiffs against the city of Seattle, from which the latter has appealed.\\nRespondents were represented in the trial court and in the perfecting of their appeal by counsel other than those who appeared for them at the time of the argument in this court.\\nRespondents, husband and wife, are owners of a tract of land in King county, located a few blocks north of the city limits of Seattle at the northwest corner of North 102nd street and Aurora avenue. The property is bounded on the east by Aurora avenue, on the south by North 102nd street, and on the west by an alley which runs north and south parallel to Aurora avenue. About twenty feet north of respondents\u2019 property, this alley is intersected by another alley running west to Linden avenue parallel to North 102nd street. Linden avenue, which runs northerly and southerly, is the next street to the west of Aurora avenue and intersects North 102nd street approximately one hundred yards west of respondents\u2019 property. With the exception of Aurora avenue, which is a primary state..highway, all of these streets and alleys are unpaved county roads.\\nRespondents\u2019 land is improved by a store building located on the southern portion of the property, fronting on Aurora avenue, on the rear or west end of which two separate additions have been built which are used for living quarters and garage and storage purposes. The original store building has a concrete foundation wall, but the two additions rest on concrete blocks. Respondents became tenants of this property in 1942, purchased it in 1944 for five thousand dollars, and began to use the additions as their home on May 9,1946.\\nIn order to understand the legal problems presented by this case, it is necessary to describe the topography of this area. North 102nd street is a graveled road which has been oiled and compacted. Immediately west of Aurora avenue, this street was graded by filling the traveled portion with gravel to an elevation somewhat higher than that of respondents\u2019 property. For a distance of one hundred fifty feet west of Aurora avenue, the street surface is almost flat, having a very slight crown. The street then begins to rise in its westerly course so that, at its intersection with Linden avenue, its elevation is about twenty-five to thirty feet higher than its elevation adjacent to respondents\u2019 property. West of Linden avenue, North 102nd street continues to rise for a considerable distance. The alley, abutting on respondents\u2019 property on the west, slopes from north to south. The general slope of the ground and the natural drainage in this vicinity is from the northwest to the southeast in the direction of respondents\u2019 property, which forms a sump or pothole.\\nThe greater quantity of surface water arising on the hill to the west of respondents\u2019 property travels south on Linden avenue to North 102nd street and east down that street to Aurora avenue. Some surface water flows east down the alley between North 102nd and North 103rd streets, turns into the alley to the west of respondents\u2019 property, and runs south toward North 102nd. Except for Aurora avenue, there are no curbs, gutters, or sewers in this area for the purpose of carrying off the surface water.\\nAccording to the testimony of respondent Sydney Stevens (who will be referred to as the respondent unless the context indicates otherwise), the surface wateri,had formed a small drainage ditch on the north side of North 102nd street to within one hundred feet of respondents\u2019 property, where it then leveled out. Prior to January, 1948, according to his testimony, the surface water, with one exception, had always flowed past his property without entering thereon. The single exception was in 1945, when surface water settled in a puddle on North 102nd street near the front of the store building, but the water disappeared after the county deposited gravel in that spot. In respondents\u2019 complaint, it was alleged that there had been repeated floodings of their premises since'May 9,1946, but at the trial respondent testified that this allegation was incorrect.\\nOn January 20, 1948, the appellant, under a franchise from King county, commenced to lay water mains on North 102nd street connecting with an existing water main on Aurora avenue and running westward. This work was done by a contractor (to whom appellant had awarded this job) with the knowledge and under the supervision of the county engineer.\\nA trench, approximately two feet wide and forty-four inches deep, was dug by appellant\u2019s contractor ten feet north of, and parallel to, the center line of the street and twenty feet from the south edge of respondents\u2019 property. The dirt was piled three or four feet high on the south side of the trench. The pipe was laid in eighteen-foot sections, and that portion of the trench was backfilled with earth and water on the same day. Two or three days later, the surface of the street was smoothed off with the blade of a \u201cscoopmobile\u201d (bulldozer with rubber tires). The surface dirt was removed by the contractor and dumped in a place remote from respondents\u2019 property.\\nThe alley to the west of respondents\u2019 property was not disturbed in any manner, since no lateral pipes were laid. The job was completed in five days on January 24, 1948. Respondent testified that, after the appellant finished its installation, a barrier of dirt about one foot high was left, which remained several days, but the street was leveled before the rain came in February, 1948.\\nThe evidence shows that the job was rather carefully inspected at every stage by both the appellant and King county to make certain that the street was left in the same condition that it was when the job was started. However, no measurements were taken to determine the precise level of the street either before or after the construction. Respondent testified that prior to the time appellant installed the water main the street was not in very good condition and had been neglected by the county. After flooding involved in this action, the county constructed a ditch on the north side of North 102nd street which has since conducted' surface water past respondents\u2019 property to the sewer in Aurora avenue.\\nDuring the actual laying of the water main, very little rain fell, but between the 13th and 18th of February, 1948, two and thirty-five hundredths inches of rain fell in this area.\\nOn February 24, 1948, respondents filed their claim for damages with the appellant city of Seattle, as well as with the county. This claim not having been acted upon within sixty days from the filing thereof, this action was thereafter commenced. Paragraphs VII, VIII and IX of this claim stated as follows:\\n\u201cVII\\n\u201cOn February 16, 1948, and prior and subsequent thereto, there was a substantial rainfall, and the surface waters and seepage flowing on said streets and alleys entered upon the claimants\u2019 property in great volume.\\n\u201cVIII\\n\u201cAs a result of the repeated flooding of claimants\u2019 premises since May 9, 1946, the soil has been gradually washed away from under the foundation walls of claimants\u2019 house and store building, causing the walls thereof to sag, causing distortions and displacements in the structure of said building. Many of the wooden timbers thereof which have been subjected to repeated water damage have become rotten, and a wooden stairway into the basement of the premises at 10207 Aurora has completely rotted out. The ground under the board walk leading from the sidewalk on North 102nd Street to claimants\u2019 front door has been washed away, causing the walk to sink. The aforesaid flooding has also damaged claimants\u2019 lawn and shrubbery.\\n\u201cIX\\n\u201cThe aforesaid damage has been gradual and cumulative, increasing with the flooding of claimants\u2019 property which has occurred after each rainfall.\u201d\\nThe contention of respondents is that the damage complained of was caused by appellant\u2019s changing the street contours while making a public improvement which resulted in the surface water flowing down the street being diverted onto their property. They maintain that the judgment can be supported either upon the constitutional provision against damaging private property for a public use (Art. I, \u00a7 16) or upon the theory of appellant\u2019s negligence. The trial court in its oral decision indicated that respondents\u2019 recovery in this action was based on the city\u2019s negligence.\\nOn the other hand, appellant contends that there is absolutely no proof that surface water was collected by it and discharged upon respondents\u2019 property in a concentrated form, and that there is no proof that the laying of the water main in North 102nd street resulted in any changing of the street contours so as to cause the flooding. Furthermore, it is argued that respondent did nothing to mitigate his damages, although he was aware of the flooding and could have protected his property at nominal expense.\\nAppellant assigns as error the making of finding off fact No. VII, the failure to sustain appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of respondents\u2019 evidence, and the entry of judgment against the city for the sum of five hundred dollars.\\nFinding No. VII reads as follows:\\n\u201cAt the time defendant City performed such work on North 102nd Street, there was no substantial rainfall. Approximately in the middle of February, 1948, there was a heavy rainfall, with the result that large amounts of surface waters collected on the high ground west of plaintiffs\u2019 property, and by virtue of the crown of North 102nd Street were prevented from flowing in their natural southeasterly course, but were conducted by open ditches on Linden Avenue and North 102nd Street to the intersection of said streets and thence east down North 102nd to the flat area immediately adjacent to plaintiffs\u2019 property. By reason of the fact that defendant City had altered the contours of said street, the said surface waters thence flowed upon plaintiffs\u2019 property in large volume, causing the foundations of their said buildings to settle, with resulting damage as hereinafter described. But for the construction work done by the defendant City as aforesaid, the said waters would have continued to flow in said street until reaching Aurora Avenue, whence they would have been conducted away by adequate drainage facilities, all without damage to plaintiff, as had been formerly the case.\u201d\\nWe have italicized the portion of this finding which is particularly to be .noted in connection with our discussion of the evidence in this case. Primarily, only questions of fact are here involved. North 102nd street, being outside of the city limits of Seattle, was entirely under the jurisdiction and control of King county. Therefore our decision in Kuhr v. Seattle, 15 Wn. (2d) 501, 131 P. (2d) 168 (cited by respondent), is not applicable.\\nRespondent calls our attention to the well-established rule that findings of the trial court made upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed by this court unless we can say that such findings are clearly not supported by the weight of the evidence, citing Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 32 Wn. (2d) 256, 201 P. (2d) 207.\\nFrom an examination of the entire record in this case, we are constrained to hold that the weight of the evidence does preponderate against the above-quoted finding. We will briefly state our reasons for so holding.\\n1. Respondent\u2019s claim against the city and county as well as the complaint (both were admitted in evidence) alleged that there had been repeated floodings of the premises since May, 1946, and that the damage had been gradual and cumulative. At the trial, he testified that these statements were erroneous, but his own witness Meroney, a former neighbor, testified in his deposition that there had been repeated floodings since 1946.\\n2. This finding was made in spite of the trial court\u2019s appraisal of respondent\u2019s testimony as unsatisfactory. In its oral decision, the trial court commented upon respondent\u2019s credibility as follows:\\n\u201cBut I must concede to counsel that the re-reading of this plaintiff\u2019s testimony does not convince me that I would be permitted to found my conclusions upon his sometimes rather disturbing testimony. He was quite an opinionated man and at times was almost flippant, not only towards his own counsel, but towards the Court and everybody else; and it was difficult to get from him just exactly what the facts were. He was bound to argue his case, and that made his own counsel\u2019s problem somewhat difficult, as it did the rest of us.\\n\u201cBut, apparently, he does not contend and does not claim to the Court that there was any dam left, a dam of loose earth left there at this point, ten feet north of the center of 102d Street at the time when the flood of -which he complains actually occurred.\u201d\\nSince respondent\u2019s testimony was not considered by the trial court as adequate to support its findings, there was no credible testimony as to the essential facts to support the judgment other than that contained in the deposition of Mr. Meroney (whom the trial court did not see or hear testify). The court characterized Mr. Meroney\u2019s testimony as \u201cnot always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\u201d The latter\u2019s testimony was outweighed by that produced by appellant.\\n3. In opposition to these two witnesses, five witnesses were called by appellant, to wit, the King county district foreman, an engineer employed by the county engineer\u2019s office, the city\u2019s contractor who performed the work, the engineer in charge of the work for the city, and the district engineer for the city. All of them testified that the surface of North 102nd street in the vicinity of respondent\u2019s property was in substantially the same condition after the water main was laid as before this work was done. Thus, the weight of the evidence is to the effect that the city did not change the contours of the street.\\n4. In testifying in rebuttal, respondent admitted that the ridge of earth which he claimed appellant had left in the street after this work was completed was leveled off before the heavy rain came in February, 1948. Respondent\u2019s only remaining cause of the flooding was that the city had changed the contours of the street. This is discussed in the preceding paragraph.\\n5. The preponderance of the evidence does not support the above-quoted finding because respondent did not sustain the burden of proving that the laying of the water main by the city was the proximate cause of the flooding. Disregarding for the moment respondent\u2019s allegations that there had been repeated flooding since 1946, his evidence merely showed that the flooding here involved occurred during the first heavy rain subsequent to the completion of the work, whereas no flooding took place just prior to doing the work at a time when there was also considerable rainfall.\\nRespondent in his brief argues that the photographs taken by him, at the time the flooding occurred, show conclusively that most of the water which damaged his premises came from North 102nd street and not from the alley which forms the westerly boundary of his property. Four of these pictures have been enlarged, and we have given all of them careful consideration. The trial court\u2019s comment regarding these pictures in its oral decision was as follows:\\n\u201cBut this water, he [respondent] claims, came, in part, down the alley to the west of his property, and partly from the west. I think he suggested he thinks about five times the quantity from the west and probably one quarter from a point to the west, meeting up with one coming from this property.\\n\u201cCol. Nelson [appellant\u2019s witness] seemed to think that more water had come down the west alley, east-and-west alley. I mean to a point west of the premises, and the area around east and west, probably than any other direction. But I do not think so, and I won\u2019t stop to refer to it. I think one of the pho'tographs taken so indicates. You can almost see the heavy burden of water that came down\u2019 along the north side of 102d Street.. The water in there, those pictures show the presence of water there, and convince me further of the actual presence of an unusual quantity of water; and that is confirmed as well by the testimony of both the plaintiff and his neighbor across the way. The neighbor\u2019s testimony is not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\\n\u201cBut the conclusive and elemental fact is that there was an excess of water which was not in accordance with the prior experience of the neighborhood within recent years, or at least that is the testimony. And he is also confronted with the fact that it should fall in exact coincidence with the preliminary construction of the water-pipe line and a rather heavy fall of rain, which followed in the succeeding month.\u201d\\nWhile the direction of the flow of the water is not as clearly discernible from the pictures as might be desired, nevertheless, if we assume respondent\u2019s conclusion that the water nearly all flowed onto respondent\u2019s property from North 102nd street to be correct, there would still not be sufficient evidence to support finding No. VII as to the cause of the flooding. The burden was upon respondent to prove that the city changed the contours of North 102nd street and that this change caused the flooding. The most favorable view of the evidence from respondent\u2019s standpoint amounts to no more than a mere possibility that the flooding might have been caused in this manner. This is insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding.\\nIn Home Ins. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 18 Wn. (2d) 798, 140 P. (2d) 507, we had occasion to consider a rule of law which is applicable to the present case. We there said:\\n\u201cThe rule is well established that the existence of a fact or facts cannot rest in guess, speculation, or conjecture. It is also the rule that the one having the affirmative of an issue does not have to make proof to an absolute certainty. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the thing in question, such as the occurrence of a fire, happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged therewith than it is that it happened in a way for which a person charged would not be liable. In applying the circumstantial evidence submitted to prove a fact, the trier of fact must recognize the distinction between that which is mere conjecture and what is a reasonable inference.\u201d\\nMore recently, in Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wn. (2d) 802, 180 P. (2d) 564, the same principle was stated briefly as follows:\\n\u201cWe have frequently said that, if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred.\u201d\\nThis rule is equally applicable whether the trier of fact be a jury or a court sitting without a jury.\\nSince w\u00bf find from the record that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding that the city changed the contour of North 102nd street in such a manner as to be the proximate cause of the flooding, the respondents are not entitled to any recovery as against the appellant upon either the theory of negligence or upon the theory of the city\u2019s damaging of their property for a public use. To recover upon the latter theory, there must be a showing that the acts of appellant resulted in the damaging of respondents\u2019 property for such purpose. The evidence applicable to this theory is insufficient to bring this case within the scope of our decision in Whiteside v. Benton County, 114 Wash. 463, 195 Pac. 519, and other similar cases cited by respondent.\\nThe judgment is reversed, with directions to dismiss the action.\\nSchwellenbach, Hill, Grady, and Hamley, JJ., concur.\""},{"id":8848167,"name":"Wilkening v. Watkins Distributors, Inc.","opinion":"\"[As amended by order of the Court of Appeals October 19, 1989.]\\nMunson, J.\\nWatkins Distributors, Inc., et al, appeal a judgment awarding damages against them, as lessees and assignees, for the cost of replacing a hot tar roof of a leased warehouse and assessing attorney fees and costs. We affirm.\\nOn June 11, 1975, Rake's Mountain Distributors, Inc. (Watkins) entered into a 5-year lease of a warehouse with the Olive Wilkening family (Wilkening). At that time, the east end of the building was being completed, and there were some interior alterations being made in the center section. That lease provided that the lessor would be responsible for structural defects during the first year and corrections would be made at lessor's expense. Thereafter, the lessor would have no responsibility for any defects \\\"which may show up in the rental unit.\\\" Attached thereto was schedule B which indicated the repairs, improvements, and alterations to the premises required of Wilkening as a condition of the lease. Roofing was included in the list; testimony revealed schedule B referred to completion of the building's new construction including roofing.\\nApproximately 2 years later, the parties began negotiations for a new lease covering the same premises. On January 1, 1978, they executed a second lease, for a 150-month term, commencing January 1, 1978, and ending July 31, 1990. Rental rates were based upon a graduated scale with the highest payments being $5,490 per month from July 1985 to June 1990. The use again was specified as a wholesale beverage distributorship unless a change of purpose was consented to by the landlord. This lease contained a general maintenance clause which placed the responsibility of maintaining and repairing the premises on the tenant and eliminated the language dealing with structural defects. Likewise, the leased premises were to be returned to the landlord in as good a condition as at the time of possession, subject to reasonable wear and tear. This lease was personally guaranteed by George Watkins and Gaston Oullet.\\nOn September 1, 1981, Watkins sold its business to B&B Distributors, Inc., which assumed the subject lease and took possession of the premises. The 1978 lease stated it could not be assigned without Wilkening's written consent; no consent was given by Wilkening. Thus, the assignment did not release Watkins from its primary responsibility for performance. OTR v. Flakey Jake's, Inc., 112 Wn.2d 243, 248, 770 P.2d 629 (1989). On March 1, 1983, B&B assigned its leasehold interest to Floor Supply Distributing, Inc., again without obtaining Wilkening's written consent. Nonetheless, as with B&B, Wilkening accepted the rent payments without objection.\\nIn 1983 following significant water leakage, Floor Supply had the warehouse roof examined by a roofing contractor. This inspection revealed the roof's deteriorated condition and the need for an entire reroofing. The west end was in the worst condition.\\nOn August 24, 1983, Wilkening's attorney sent Watkins a letter advising the roof on the west end was in need of immediate repair and maintenance; that Watkins was responsible pursuant to the lease to repair it; and absent action by Watkins, the roof would be repaired at Wilken-ing's direction and repayment sought. Watkins disagreed. Thereafter Wilkening had the west portion of the roof replaced at a cost of $8,828.82, and with a cover letter, sent the work invoice to Watkins seeking reimbursement. Watkins declined payment.\\nThe rest of the roof continued to leak causing damage to Floor Supply's inventory. On October 9, 1985, Wilkening's attorney sent a similar letter to Watkins indicating the need to reroof the remaining portions. A bid was acquired and forwarded to Watkins. Upon receiving no response, Wilkening had the work performed in August 1986. The total cost was $22,353.89. Once again, Wilkening's request for reimbursement was declined by Watkins based on a denial of liability.\\nWilkening brought this action seeking reimbursement for the entire cost of the reroofing. There is evidence that a tar roof requires a maintenance coat of tar, usually applied with a mop, every 3 to 5 years. The original tar roof was guaranteed by the roofing contractor for 10 years provided this maintenance program is followed. While there is factual dispute as to the average age of a tar roof, the court found that the roof lasted beyond its life expectancy. The court further found it was the intent of the parties that this roof would \\\"endure the leasehold period,\\\" i.e., 15 years. The court concluded Watkins breached the general maintenance clause of the lease by failing to maintain the roof. Damages were imposed for the costs of roof replacement along with attorney fees and costs.\\nThe primary issue is whether the lease's general maintenance provision imposes a duty upon Watkins as lessee to apply periodic hot tar treatments to the roof of the leased building.\\nIn interpreting a lease, we examine the document itself and \\\"determine the mutual intentions of the contracting parties according to the reasonable meaning of their words and acts.\\\" Fisher Properties, Inc. v.

The tenant at its expense shall maintain the rental unit in every respect, in a state of good repair and in good condition throughout the term of this lease.\\n(Italics ours.) (The paragraph continues as to the tenant's duty to maintain sidewalks and access ways free of ice and snow, keep all drainage pipes open, the building properly heated, and replace any broken glass.)\\nParagraph 8 states in part:\\nTenant shall assume, exclusively, full risk for damage to the rental unit including but not restricted to the building and fixtures which may result from fire, from the elements and from any other cause.\\n(Italics ours.) (The lease then speaks of the tenant's responsibility to maintain fire insurance.)\\nParagraph 11 states in part:\\nUpon termination of the lease the premises shall be returned to the possession of Landlords in condition as good as they are at the time possession thereof is taken by Tenant, subject, however, to reasonable wear and tear which will have taken place through normal use by Tenant.\\nThere is no provision designating either party's responsibility for the roof, as was found in Puget Inv. Co. v. Wenck, 36 Wn.2d 817, 221 P.2d 459, 20 A.L.R.2d 1320 (1950) and McManamon v. Tobiason, 75 Wash. 46, 134 P. 524 (1913). Nor is there anything in the record to indicate the issue of maintaining the roof was discussed by the original parties to the lease or that Watkins and its assignees were aware, at the inception of the lease or assignment, that a tar roof required a mop maintenance every 3 to 5 years. Watkins defended on the theory that a roof was a structural part of the building, which might from time to time require major and permanent repairs, and thus not the tenant's responsibility.\\nWashington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, supra, held in part that a general obligation to maintain the premises and upon expiration of the lease surrender it in as good condition as when the lessee took possession, except for ordinary wear and tear, did not require lessee to rebuild the premises when it was destroyed by fire. Thus, the court overruled the common law as enunciated in Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897) and its progeny. However, as noted earlier, the court stated: \\\"As we said in Armstrong, what controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used. ... We will not extend the obligation of lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used ...\\\" Payne, at 328.\\nAs noted previously, this lease provides the tenant has \\\"the sole responsibility for maintenance and repair\\\" of the unit, at its expense, in every respect; further, that the tenant \\\"assume[s], exclusively, full risk for damage\\\" to the unit, be it from fire, from the elements, or from any other cause. At the conclusion of paragraph 8, from which the preceding text was taken and after discussion of insurance coverage, the lease provides: \\\"Landlords shall have no responsibility whatsoever.\\\" This combination of language imposes a heavy responsibility upon the tenant; the trial court so found in holding the tenant responsible for maintenance in order to permit the roof to endure during the leasehold period. The court's findings are supported by substantial evidence.\\nWe find Watkins' analogy to Payne, while not requiring rebuilding of a destroyed structure, is not applicable when replacement of a roof covering is a result of the tenant's failure to perform proper maintenance as required by the terms of the lease.\\nThe lease provides for attorney fees.\\nThe judgment is affirmed and the case remanded for determination of reasonable attorney fees on appeal.\\nThompson, C.J., and Green, J., concur.\\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied October 19, 1989.\\nReview denied at 114 Wn.2d 1003 (1990).\\nRake's Mountain Distributors subsequently changed its name to Watkins Distributors.\\nThe warehouse building is 105 feet in width and approximately 507 feet in length.

The first, the west end, was constructed in 1968, consisted of 13,000 square feet, was recoated in 1975 per the terms of the original lease and was reroofed in 1984. The second, the center section, was constructed in 1973, consisted of 24,000 square feet, and was reroofed in August 1986. The third section, the east end, was constructed in 1974, consisted of 13,000 square feet, and was reroofed in August 1986. It was to be used only as a wholesale beverage distributorship unless consent of the lessor was given.\\nWhile examination of the lease language as a whole provides for such a result, a specific provision dealing with hot tar treatment, including time frames, and allocation of responsibility for the same would avoid such problems in the future.\""},{"id":674990,"name":"Woolworth Co. v. City of Seattle","opinion":"\"Mitchell, J.\\nAppellant, plaintiff below, was engaged in the mercantile business in the Arcade Building, in Seattle. In addition to its salesroom, it occupied the basement underneath for the storage, receiving, checking and shipping of its merchandise. It was a tenant of the premises, the basement of which abuts upon University street. The city maintained a sewer in University street. Radiating from this sewer there was a lateral sewer from and accommodating the premises used by appellant. On March 5, 1917, there was an average heavy rainfall, when the basement became flooded, causing damage to appellant\u2019s goods and merchandise which, together with the cost of removing and cleaning the same, amounted to the alleged sum of $448.56. Charging the city with negligence in maintaining a main sewer on University street inadequate to meet the burden imposed upon it, resulting in the damage referred to, appellant presented to the city its duly verified claim for damages, the rejection of which occasioned this action. The city, by its answer, denied liability, and affirmatively answered, alleging contributory negligence. The case was tried without a jury. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a non-suit. Upon the request of defendant, findings of fact were made, upon which a judgment of dismissal was entered. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.\\nOn the date mentioned, and for some years prior thereto, there was in force an ordinance of the city which, inter alia, provides:\\n\u201cAll cellar and basement drains must, when connected to sewer, ... be protected from backwater by backwater valves; said backwater valves must be provided with an air-tight clean-out cover placed immediately above valve, either screwed or bolted in place, capable of being removed for examination or repairs.\u201d Ordinance No. 22,839, \u00a7 32.\\nIn the basement there was installed an iron manhole or receiving water tank, some two feet deep and about the same in diameter, narrower at the top, on which was placed, flush with the floor, a latticed circular iron cover having a mesh about two inches square. Within the manhole the intake of the drain pipe formed an elbow, the end of which, turned down and submerged in water when in place, was below the bottom of the stem of the drain pipe, thus forming a trap to prevent odors escaping from the sewer. On the stem of the pipe near the elbow and within the manhole there was constructed a backwater valve and cover as provided by the ordinance of the city. The drain pipe ran into a larger one from the building and thence into the University street main sewer. The water that flooded the basement poured back boiling out of the manhole.\\nIt is the contention of appellant that the incapacity of the main sewer alone caused the flooding, while the respondent claims the backwater valve had been allowed to become unclean and clogged by the fault-of appellant, thus causing the flooding and damage. The trial court found the main sewer inadequate, to which the city took no exception, and also found the appellant negligent in not keeping the backwater valve clean and in proper repair, to which appellant excepted. There is no testimony to show the backwater valve was structurally insufficient or out of repair.\\nThere was ample testimony by the head janitor, superintendent, and assistant superintendent of the building, and by E. M. Barstow, manager of appellant\u2019s mercantile business in Seattle, all of whom witnessed the flooding, to justify the finding that all the water which caused the damage backed up from the street sewer through the drain pipe and manhole into the basement.\\nOn the other hand, O. A. Davis, appellant\u2019s witness, a plumber and member of the firm that put in the plumbing, testified in detail as to its construction and operation, using a backwater valve to illustrate and explain its proper purpose and functions. It appears the backwater valve consisted of a solid door which hung vertically inside the drain pipe from a hinge, and when undisturbed rested against the surface of a circular collar or shoulder. Water escaping from the basement through the manhole and drain pipe would have no trouble in causing the door of the backwater valve to yield, while wafer backing up the drain pipe would force the door of the backwater valve against the shoulder and thus prevent the further passage of water, assuming always there is no debris or trash to clog the proper operation of the door of the backwater valve. The plumber stated that, if the door to the valve were free, backwater from the sewer could not pass \u2014 the harder the pressure from that direction all the better, if possible, to prevent the backwater from passing. Appellant attempted to meet the force of this testimony by showing the basement floor was cleaned at-the end of each day\u2019s work; but considering the manner in which the backwater valve was constructed, and the further fact that there was no fine screen over either the manhole or the intake of the drain pipe, nor other device to prevent debris from getting into the valve, the flooding backward from the sewer is explainable on no reasonable theory other than that the door to the valve had been rendered useless by reason of carelessness in permitting waste matter to get into and clog the door of the backwater .valve.\\nCounsel for appellant also contends that a part of the flood water or sewage came back into the basement through the toilet. We do not so understand the proof. The rear of the basement was fifteen inches higher than that where the flood occurred. The toilet was situated in the rear basement, but all the witnesses who testified on this point said the damage was done by water pouring back through the manhole in the lower basement. The evidence does not show how the plumbing was constructed from the toilet into the sewer. One witness only, E. C. Barstow, testified there was backwater through the toilet, but the record shows that, later in the trial, when another witness was being examined with reference to this, Mr. Bar-stow, to clear np some apparent confusion, stated to the court: \u201cWater came from the toilet but did no damage in the basement. This damage all came through the manhole.\u201d Counsel for appellant argues that Mr. Barstow was not testifying when the statement was made. Appellant is bound by the statement, however, as an admission during trial, for Mr. Barstow was general manager for appellant in the conduct of the business which had suffered the loss, and was such manager and agent at the time of the trial.\\nThe finding of negligence against the respondent is unchallenged. The evidence preponderates in support of the finding of contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. The two acts of negligence concurring and co-operating constituted the proximate cause or occasion of the damage complained of, thus precluding a recovery. Franklin v. Engel, 34 Wash. 480, 76 Pac. 84; 20 R. C. L., Negligence, \u00a7\u00a7 88, 89.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nMain, C. J., Mackintosh, and Tolman, JJ., concur.\""},{"id":630224,"name":"Imperial Candy Co. v. City of Seattle","opinion":"\"Main, J.\\nThe purpose of this action was to recover damages to personal property caused by the breaking of a water main owned by the city of Seattle. The defendant, The J. M. Colman Company, was the owner of the building in which the property was at the time the damage occurred. The trial resulted in a judgment of dismissal as to the Colman Company, and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the city in the sum of $1,051.93, together with interest.\\nThe facts are these: On March 3, 1913, the respondent was occupying, and for about nine years previous had occupied, rooms in the basement of the building owned by the Colman Company, the west front of which was on Western avenue. One of the city water mains extended along this avenue. Under the sidewalk on the east side of the street a pit had been constructed in which the water meter was placed. The service pipe leading from the street main to the pit was approximately four inches ip diameter. After the pipe entered the pit, it was reduced to a three-inch pipe. For this purpose it was necessary to use an elbow and bushing. The bushing used in making the connection was cast iron. The three-inch pipe extended from the place where the connection was made to the meter and into the building. About ten years previous to the date mentioned, the first meter had been installed in the pit upon a foundation consisting of boards placed upon the earth. At the time the main broke, the boards had become decayed, and the only inference from the evidence is that the foundation of the meter had become so defective as not longer to furnish it support. The meter not being supported by the foundation, its weight was carried by the pipe to which it was attached, and the strain caused by this weight was borne by the cast-iron bushing. The meter when filled with water would weigh three or four hundred pounds. There was more or less hammering in the pipes due to the large amount of water which was used for operating elevators.\\nWhen the pipe broke, a stream of water from the four-inch opening extended upwards approximately thirty feet. Some of this water found its way into the room in the basement in which the respondent\u2019s property was stored. This property consisted of crackers, sugar, candy, and other like articles. The water upon the floor of this basement became six or eight inches deep.\\nThe theory of the action was that the cast-iron bushing which broke was improper construction, and that the city had not exercised reasonable care in inspecting and replacing the foundation under the meter. The evidence sustains the position that the use of the cast-iron bushing was improper construction. The evidence also shows that the condition of the foundation under the meter could readily have been ascertained by an inspection. Access to the pit in which the meter was placed could be made through an opening in the sidewalk through which the meter reader entered the pit.\\nIt is claimed that the city was negligent in one or two other particulars, which need not be referred to, as, in our opinion, the condition of the foundation under the meter was readily ascertainable by a reasonable inspection. The failure to inspect and replace the foundation was not the exercise of the proper degree of care on the part of the city. The lack of a foundation, together with the use of the cast-iron bushing instead of a metal of greater strength, was what caused the break and permitted the water to escape.\\nIn this connection some claim is made that, even though the city were negligent in the particulars mentioned, such negligence was not the proximate cause of the damage to the respondent\u2019s property. But this contention cannot be sustained. The damage to the property was plainly the natural and probable consequence of the breaking of the main. The damage which occurred was such as would reasonably be anticipated by the breaking of a water main and releasing a stream of water the size of that mentioned. The case of Ottevaere v. Spokane, 89 Wash. 681, 155 Pac. 146, was based upon a different state of facts, and is not controlling.\\nAnother contention of the city is that the respondent was negligent in using the basement of the building because there was no drain therein as required by the city ordinance. The respondent was not the owner of the building, but a tenant of the owner. The evidence shows that the floor of the basement was below the level of the sewers in the adj acent streets. It is not claimed that the concrete floor in the basement was constructed without first having obtained a permit from the city as required by the building ordinance. The ordinance referred to did not forbid the use by a tenant of a basement in which no drain had been constructed. We think the respondent, in storing his property in this basement, was not guilty of negligence.\\nThe judgment will be affirmed.\\nMorris, C.

Hull","opinion":"\"Holcomb, J.\\nAppellant, subtenant of a former lessee of a former owner of certain premises in Seattle, sued respondents, subsequent purchasers from the former owner of the property, for damages alleged to have been caused by water issuing from unprotected pipes upon portions of the premises over which respondents had exclusive control and appellant had none, claiming the total sum of $3,295.26.\\nUpon issue being joined and the case tried, the court made findings of fact which explain the nature of the case as briefly as can be done. The findings are as follows:\\n\u201cI. On July 17, 1919, one George G. Gross was the owner of the building referred to in the complaint. It consisted of a basement, five storerooms fronting on Union Street, numbered from the corner store, which was No. 500 Union Street, easterly to the alley in the block, the other street numbers being 504, 506, 508 and 510, and a hotel on the floors above. On that date the owner leased to Converse Co. Inc., a corporation, the storeroom numbered 510 and all of the basement of the building, except a furnace room situate on the northeast corner of the basement. On April .30, 1921, the Converse Co. Inc., sublet to the plaintiff the northerly portion of such basement, and the possession under said lease and sub-lease continued in the lessee and sub-tenant respectively until after May 22, 1922.\\n\u201cII. On or about March 1, 1921, said store-room No. 506 was under lease from said Gross for a term then unexpired, and on the date last named the lessee thereof assigned his lease to one Stockhoff, who took possession of the leased premises and remained there in possession until on or about June 30,1921.\\n\u201cIII. At the time Stockhoff moved in there was no water connection in or to said store-room No. 506. He installed a water supply in said store-room. This supply was by means of two half-inch pipes running between the floor of No. 506 and the ceiling of the basement shortly thereafter occupied by the plaintiff. One of these pipes was connected with the cold water system by tapping the pipe which supplied cold water to a sink or basin theretofore and now located toward the rear or western end of a hall-way which extended along the rear of said store-room No. 504, 506, 508 and 510. The flow of water at the point of connection was controlled by a cut-off then separately installed for that purpose. That hall-way was used in common by the tenants of said store-rooms numbered 506, 508 and 510, and by the basement tenants other than the tenant of the furnace room. Said cold water pipe extended from under said sink down beneath the floor of the hall-way and thence through an opening in the partition and into said space between said floor and ceiling for a distance of 20 feet or thereabouts. It then had an elbow deflecting it up to and through the floor of No. 506. The hot water pipe paralleled the course of the cold water pipe in said space between ceiling and floor, and turned by an elbow at the same point and passed up through the floor into said storeroom. The method of this installation was not known to said Gross or his agents. On or about August 1, 1921, the said Gross leased No. 506 to one O\u2019Brien, who thereupon moved in and remained there until about May 1, 1922. From thence until after May 22, 1922, said store-room No. 506 remained vacant. All of that water connection which extended above the floor was taken out by Stoekkoff when he moved out. Shortly after O \u2019Brien moved in all that was visible of the same was the two holes in the floor referred to, and a hole for the waste pipe and each of the two first-named contained a cap such as is used in plumbing for capping a half-inch pipe. In December, 1921, the defendants bought said building from said Gross and conveyance being made accordingly. At that time and thereafter until May 22, 1922, the condition last above described as existing in said room No. 506 continued without change.\\n\u201cIV. On the night of May 20, and during May 21st and the early hours of May 22, 1922, the stock of wall paper of the plaintiff stored in said portion of basement occupied by the plaintiff became damaged by water escaping on to it from the ceiling above. A plumber employed in the emergency crawled with difficulty into the opening above referred to and, dragging his body along the said two pipes to the end of the same, discovered the cause was that said cold water pipe was open at its extremity. Some person unknown maliciously or otherwise disposed (not the plaintiff nor either of the defendants nor any employee or agent of them or either of them nor the tenant of No. 508) had turned the cutoff under the sink aforesaid so that the water flowed out through that pipe over onto the basement ceiling and through it upon said stock of goods. At that time the caps aforesaid, screwed on to nipples, remained in the floor above, extending down through the floor, but there was a gap between the top of the elbow and the bottom of the nipple of about one foot. How this condition came about, the evidence does not disclose. A preponderance of the evidence is that it existed from the time Stockhoff moved out.\\n\u201cV. Neither the said Gross nor the defendants nor the plaintiff nor any agent of either ever knew of the existence of that condition until after it was repaired on the morning of May 22,1922, and in the exercise of ordinary prudence none of them could have discovered it. The existence and location of the caps in the floor visible from above indicated that the water supply had been properly protected by caps so that water could not escape from the supply pipes and any person viewing the same would have been justified in so concluding. The space between the floor and ceiling above referred to was in total darkness so that the condition at the end of the pipes was only discoverable in the manner in which it was discovered as aforesaid and then only by carrying artificial light into the place. The cut-off under the sink was of the ordinary type, but was not visible to one observing the sink except by the intrusion below the sink of artificial light. Access to said sink was open during business hours. The entrance to said hallway from outside the building was controlled by said Converse Co., and whenever that company closed its establishment said door was locked. It was so locked at about five P. M. of May 20th.\\n\u201cVI. The water was flowing at eight o\u2019clock on said Saturday night, but the evidence does not show when the flow began, the preponderance being that the flow commenced between five and eight o \u2019clock of that day. During that period of time the access to the sink was possible only to the occupants or visitors to said store-rooms numbered 508 and 510. The fact that water was escaping was not discovered until eight o\u2019clock on said Monday morning.\u201d\\nUpon these findings the court concluded that appellant had no right of recovery.\\nAppellant excepted to certain findings made by the court and to the refusal of the court to make findings requested by it. The errors claimed are:\\n1. In finding that the condition of the water connections and the pipe ends in the floor of No. 506 gave no notice of the dangerous defect.\\n2. In finding that the defendants and their agents knew nothing of the condition of the pipes until after the accident.\\n3. In refusing to find it to be the duty of the defendants to have made careful examination of the plumbing and water pipes, especially those indicated by the holes in the floor of No. 506; and in refusing to find that the defendants were guilty of negligence in not so doing.\\n4. In entering judgment in favor of defendants; and that the findings do not sustain the judgment.\\n5. In overruling the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial.\\nThere is no error in either of the findings first assailed, for the evidence sustains them. In fact, as to the1 first claim there is no contradiction in the evidence; and as to the second claimed error, the only claim is that of imputed notice to the former owner and his agent, which cannot be imputed to the later one, who had no actual notice.\\nThe principal point of contention is upon the third assignment.\\nUnder this claim appellant contends that the owner of the premises is an insurer of his tenant in one part of the premises for damages flowing from a defect in another part of the premises which other part is under the control of the owner and not under the control of the tenant. Cases from other jurisdictions are cited and it is insisted that the case of Le Vette v. Hardman Estate, 77 Wash. 320, 137 Pac. 454, L. R. A. 1917B 222, sustains that contention.\\nAppellant is in error. By reference to the Le Vette case, it will he found that the basis of the complaint was negligence. There was some evidence to show negligence on the part of the landlord, but the trial court dismissed the action by the tenant on granting the nonsuit. This court held that the failure to exercise proper superintendence over the upper story of the building in question might be held to be negligence, and that at least it was a question that should have been submitted to the jury.\\nThat is not the case here. In this case the trial judge heard the witnesses and resolved the evidence against the allegations of negligence upon competent and credible evidence. He also found that respondents had no notice of the defect, and that the defects in the plumbing could not be discovered by ordinary care and prudence. He viewed the premises himself and was able to judge of the conditions accurately.\\nWe have never held that a landlord is an insurer of the premises of the tenant, but in fact have held to the contrary, as in the LeVette case, supra, that the landlord is bound to ordinary care only, and liable only for negligence for lack of such care. Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873.\\nAnd a sub-tenant has no greater rights against the owner than has his immediate landlord, the sub-lessor. Mesher v.

Riebli","opinion":"\"Ott, J.\\nOctober 30,1954, the Washington Building Company leased \u201cthat certain store space known as 1025 Pacific Avenue,\u201d in Tacoma, Washington, to Donald H. Hutch-ins for an ice cream and soda fountain business. November 30, 1955, the lease was assigned to Arthur A. Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., with the consent of the building company. During the weekend prior to October 29, 1956, a water pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the leased premises ruptured. Monday morning at 7:30 a. m., the maintenance superintendent of the building company discovered that the basement of the building had been flooded. The flow of water from the ruptured pipe was shut off by a valve which controlled the service of water to the leased premises. The water caused damage to some doors stored by the building company in a basement storeroom, to merchandise stored by the Washington Camera Mart in its basement storeroom, and to a rug on the floor in the basement safe-deposit vault lobby of the United Mutual Savings Bank.\\nThe Washington Camera Mart brought suit against Riebli and Hoertrich to recover for its loss. The bank sued Riebli, Hoertrich, and the building company. The building company cross-complained against Riebli and Hoertrich for damages to its doors and for indemnity for any damages it might be required to pay to the bank. The causes were consolidated for trial.\\nThe court entered judgment for both plaintiffs and also entered judgment for the building company on its cross-complaint. Riebli and Hoertrich have appealed.\\nThe evidence disclosed, inter alia, (1) that the respondents\u2019 premises were damaged by water; (2) that the water came from a ruptured pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the premises leased by the appellants; (3) that the pipe was installed in 1947, with the consent of the building company, by a former tenant when he remodeled the premises, and had since remained untouched; (4) that water was supplied by the building company to the appellants\u2019 premises through a system of pipes which it maintained and over which it retained control, the water being piped to a reservoir on the top floor of the building and from there to the various parts of the building; (5) that the appellants were not assignees of Fox, who had installed the pipe, but were in possession as the assignees of the Hutchins lease, and (6) that the lease provided that the tenants had the duty to keep the leased premises in repair and, under certain conditions, to save the building company harmless from occupational liability.\\nThe court predicated appellants\u2019 liability to the Washington Camera Mart and to the bank upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court erred in applying the doctrine to the facts of this case.\\nBefore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied, exclusive control of the offending instrumentality by the appellants must be established by the evidence. In this regard, Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) 204, \u00a7 42, states the rule as follows:\\n\u201cIt is never enough for the plaintiff to prove merely that he has been injured by the negligence of someone unidentified. Even though there is beyond all possible doubt negligence in the air, it is still necessary to bring it home to the defendant. On this too the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; and in any case where it is clear that it is at least equally probable that the negligence was that of another, the court must instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not proved his case. . . .\\n\u201cThis element usually is stated as meaning that the defendant must be in \u2018exclusive control\u2019 of the instrumentality which has caused the accident. . . .\\n\u201c. . . It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of \u2018control\u2019 were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\u201d\\nIn Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 31 Wn. (2d) 282, 294, 196 P. (2d) 744 (1948), this court said:\\n\u201c . . . one of the elements essential to the invocation of that doctrine [res ipsa loquitur] is that the party charged with actionable negligence must have sole and exclusive control of the agency or instrumentality which actually caused the injury. If there is no such exclusive control, or if the injury was caused, or may reasonably be said to have been caused, by the concurrent acts of two or more persons or agencies functioning independently of each other, the doctrine does not apply.\u201d\\nAccord, 1 Shearman and Redfield, Negligence (Rev. ed.) 153, \u00a7 56; 65 C. J. S. 1014 et seq., \u00a7 220 (8).\\nIn Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099 (1956), we recognized that the requirement of control does not mean actual physical control, but refers to legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality that caused the injury.\\nUnder the facts of this case, was the offending pipe under the exclusive control of the appellants?\\nRespondents rely upon Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811 (1957). In the cited case, a water main was held to be under the \u201cexclusive control\u201d of the city, when it was installed by the city, maintained by the city up to and at the time of the accident, and the water was supplied by the city. See, also, Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958).\\nIn the instant case, the appellants did not install the offending pipe. They did not select the kind or quality of pipe used. They had no control over the water supply. The evidence failed to establish the element of \u201cexclusive control,\u201d which is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\\nFurther, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is based in part upon the theory that negligence will be presumed because the defendant either knew of the cause of the accident, or had the best opportunity of ascertaining the cause and, therefore, should be required to produce evidence in explanation. Shay v. Parkhurst, 38 Wn. (2d) 341, 229 P. (2d) 510 (1951); Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., supra; Lynch v. Ninemire Packing Co., 63 Wash. 423, 115 Pac. 838 (1911).\\nIn this case, there was no proof that the appellants had prior knowledge of the cause of the accident or that they had the best opportunity to know of it. When they took possession of the premises, the imbedded pipe was in place and had remained there untouched during their occupancy.\\nThere remains the question of whether the judgment in favor of the Washington Building Company and against the appellants can be sustained because of the following provisions of the lease:\\n\u201cThe Parties Hereto Further Agree, As Follows: . . .\\n\u201c(2) Throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep same in good repair, and at or before the end of the term will repair all injury done by the installation or removal of equipment and fixtures, it being understood that the Lessee shall have the right to remove equipment and fixtures; and, at the end of the term, the Lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. . . .\\n\u201c(6) The Lessor shall not be liable for damage caused the Lessee by bursting or leaking of any water, gas, or steam pipe by accident or by neglect of other tenants or occupants of the building or their employees. . . .\\n\u201c (8) The Lessor shall have the right to enter the premises at reasonable times and intervals to examine the same or to make repairs or alterations. . . .\\n\u201c(11) The Lessee agrees to use the leased premises as a careful and prudent person would use his own, and upon the expiration of the term to surrender the premises to the Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term of this lease, save for wear and tear from reasonable and careful use. . . .\\n\u201c (14) The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, the Lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the Lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the Lessee.\u201d\\nRespondents rely upon \u00a7 14, supra. Liability under that section of the lease arises upon (1) appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the lease, and (2) damages arising from or out of appellants\u2019 occupancy of the premises.\\nAs to (1), it was not shown that appellants failed to comply with the terms of the lease. Regarding (2), we are of the opinion that, construing the contract as a whole, the parties intended that the appellants were obligated to \u201ctake good care\u201d of the leased premises during their occupancy, and to make a reasonable and careful use thereof. They were liable only for damage caused by unreasonable and careless use of the premises. The imbedded pipe in some manner ruptured during the appellants\u2019 occupancy. The fact of the rupture alone does not establish that the use of the premises by the appellants was unreasonable or careless. The burden of proving that the water damage was caused by appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms and covenants of the lease, or by their unreasonable use of the premises, was not met by the respondents.\\nNor does the covenant (\u00a72, supra) which placed upon the appellants the duty to repair make them insurers of latent defects in the premises. The covenant to repair carries with it no more than the duty to repair known defects or defects which could have been discovered by the exercise of due care. Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., 79 Wash. 643, 140 Pac. 909 (1914); Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873 (1893).\\nThere is no evidence in the record before us that the defect was known to the appellants or that appellants, by the exercise of due care, could have discovered it. The proof established nothing more than a latent defect for which appellants assumed no contractual liability.\\nFinally, respondents contend that the offending pipe was a trade fixture. Assuming, arguendo, that the pipe, at the time it was installed by the then tenant, Fox, was a trade fixture and so regarded by Fox and the owner of the building, it lost its identity as a trade fixture and became part of the building when it was leased by the owner as a part of the over-all premises to the appellants\u2019 assignor, Hutchins.\\n\u201c \u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d Forman v. Columbia Theater Co., 20 Wn. (2d) 685, 695, 148 P. (2d) 951 (1944), quoting with approval from Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834 (1905).\\nApplying these tests to the facts in the instant case, the pipe was securely imbedded in the concretelike floor, and was applied to the use of these premises as an ice cream parlor and soda fountain. The actual intention of Fox, who made the annexation, does not appear, but, from the above and from the fact that he did not remove it at the termination of his lease, we must presume that his intention was to make the pipe a permanent annexation to the freehold. Under these facts, it is clear that the pipe became a permanent part of the building company\u2019s water supply system and was leased as a part of the freehold to appellants\u2019 assignor.\\nFor the reasons stated, the judgments are reversed, and the causes remanded with instructions to enter judgments dismissing the complaints and the cross-complaint.\\nWeaver, C. J., Hill, Donworth, Finley, and Foster, JJ., concur.\", \"Hunter, J.\\n(dissenting)\u2014A more detailed statement of the facts is necessary to better understand the reasoning of this dissent.\\nThe record discloses that the appellant lessees, in the conduct of their business, maintained and operated a motor-driven compressor as a part of their refrigeration equipment situated within the premises, which compressor required a constant supply of water for cooling purposes; that the lessees, in the conduct of their business, obtained water from the Building Company for various uses on their premises, for which they paid a monthly flat fee to the lessor; that they obtained their water supply by means of an entrance pipe through the floor of their premises, connected to the general building water supply system.\\nThe testimony in the record, which the trial court was entitled to believe, discloses that immediately inside appellants\u2019 premises on the entrance pipe was a hand-operated control valve by which the flow of water beyond that point could be turned off and on; that from that point on water was distributed to the various points of use within appellants\u2019 premises by plumbing installed by previous tenants; that in order to supply cold water to the appellants\u2019 refrigeration compressor, a pipe, connected with the other plumbing within the premises, was placed under the surface of the floor of their premises; that the floor was laid by a prior tenant; that the flow of water in the pipe was controlled by the same valve within the premises that controlled the flow through the rest of the plumbing; that one of the appellants, George Hoertrich, Jr., was the electrical contractor for the tenant who installed the floor and pipe, and did the electrical work incident to the installation of the compressor, which was the same compressor situated on the premises maintained and operated by the appellants, when the accident occurred on October 29,1956. The record further shows that the pipe was installed on the floor of the premises by being laid upon or partially recessed therein, and was covered with a one' to two-inch terrazzo floor, which is a type of floor laid similar to concrete with the same hardening characteristics; that the original floor was of twelve-inch reinforced concrete, and beneath this floor there is an area of approximately two feet followed by a false ceiling suspended over respondents\u2019 premises. The space between the false ceiling and the concrete floor contains various utilities for the building. In its determination of the source of the escaping water, the trial court found that it resulted from a rupture in the pipeline in the terrazzo floor.\\nIn view of the result of this dissent, it is necessary to discuss certain contentions of the appellants in addition to those considered by the majority. Hence, for continuity, all of the appellants\u2019 contentions will be discussed in order, without reference to the majority opinion.\\nAppellants contend first, that the evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was from a rupture of the pipe in the floor of appellants\u2019 premises. I disagree. The building superintendent testified that the water was running through the ceiling directly beneath the appellants\u2019 premises when the damage was discovered; that there was no other plumbing in that area except the appellants\u2019 plumbing; and that he immediately notified the appellants. The record shows that the appellants thereupon called a plumber who shut off the water at the valve through which the water flows into the appellants\u2019 plumbing from the line of the building supplying the water to appellants\u2019 premises. The water leakage promptly subsided. The plumber bypassed the pipe in the floor, which went to the appellants\u2019 compressor, with copper tubing to carry the water and there was no further difficulty encountered. The building superintendent further testified that, based on his years of experience in maintenance and plumbing work, he believed the break could be caused by a chemical reaction between the galvanizing of the pipe and the concrete floor.\\nConsidering the testimony in its entirety and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was a ruptured pipe in the floor of appellants\u2019 premises.\\nThe appellants further contend the trial court erred in finding that the appellants had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing the damage. The appellants contend the control was in the lessor. I believe an examination of the record discloses the contrary. The lease expressly provides:\\n\u201cThroughout the term of this lease, the lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep the same in good repair, . . . and, at the end of the term, the lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted.\u201d (Italics mine.)\\nThe court found, as supported by the record, that the ruptured pipe was a part of the plumbing used exclusively in the operation of the appellants\u2019 business. The pipe could be used for that purpose only, and was not in any manner related to the use of the remainder of the building. The ruptured pipe was clearly a part of, and appurtenant to the use of, the demised premises, which the appellants were bound to maintain and repair under the lease and over which they necessarily had control under these circumstances. The appellants argue, however, that they did not have exclusive control since they could not disturb the terrazzo floor without permission of the lessor, on the theory that it would constitute an alteration requiring the consent of the lessor, as provided in the lease. I disagree. The lease must be read in its entirety. The disturbing of the floor would only be an incident to the appellants\u2019 obligation to repair the pipe and would not be an alteration, since the restoration of the floor would be required under the provision of the lease providing for the surrender of the premises in good order and condition at the end of the term (reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted).\\nThe appellants further contend that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable in this case. The doctrine was recently considered by this court in the case of Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958). There we stated:\\n\u201cUnder our recent decision in Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811, the rule is:\\n\u201c Where a plaintiff\u2019s evidence establishes that an instrumentality under the exclusive control of the defendants caused an injurious occurrence, which ordinarily does not happen if those in control of the instrumentality use ordinary care, there is an inference, permissible from the occurrence itself, that it was caused by the defendant\u2019s want of care. Nopson v. Wockner, 40 Wn. (2d) 645, 245 P. (2d) 1022. Legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality which caused the injury and a superior, if not exclusive, position for knowing or obtaining knowledge of the facts which caused the injury, provide a sufficient basis for the application of the doctrine. Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099. When these circumstances are shown, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case, and it devolves upon the defendant to produce evidence to meet and offset the effect of the presumption. Hogland v. Klein, supra.\u2019 \u201d (Italics mine.)\\nIn the instant case, finding of fact No. 9 reads as follows:\\n\u201cThat the Defendants, Arthur Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing said damage, and that the cause of said occurrence has not been satisfactorily explained, nor have said Defendants shown that they exercised due care to prevent the happening of the occurrence or excused themselves for their failure to do so.\u201d\\nThe above finding, which is supported by the record, shows that (1) the appellants had exclusive control of the instrumentality causing the damage; (2) that no showing was made by the appellants of their exercise of due care to prevent the occurrence causing the damage; and (3) that no explanation has been made by the appellants to excuse them from failing to exercise due care in the control and operation of the instrumentality causing the damage.\\nUnder the facts in the instant case, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, as stated in the Klise case, supra, applies. The appellants have failed to produce evidence to offset the effect of the presumption of the appellants\u2019 want of due care and they should therefore be liable for the damage incurred.\\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding judgment for damages to the building on the Building Company\u2019s cross-complaint against the appellants, and in awarding the Building Company a judgment against the appellants for any damages it may sustain as a result of the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants. I do not agree. The covenant under the lease expressly provides the lessees will hold the lessor harmless from any and all damages occurring to the lessor whatsoever, as a result of the lessees\u2019 use and occupancy of the premises. The lease states:\\n\u201cThe lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of, the occupancy by, or under, the lessee, the lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the lessee, or any failure on the lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the lessee.\u201d\\nThe damage sustained by the Building Company, as alleged in the cross-complaint, and resulting from the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants, was a direct result of the lessees\u2019 use and occupancy of its premises, and the court was therefore correct in its ruling.\\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding damages to the Washington Camera Mart for the loss of anticipated profits from the Christmas business of that year. The trial court was justified in finding that, as a result of the damage occurring on October 29,1956, there was insufficient time for any of the stock of damaged merchandise to be replaced. The finding of lost profits was properly supported by the record, showing that the Camera Mart had been in operation since 1946, and that the Christmas seasons of 1955 and 1956 were comparable as far as general Christmas buisness was concerned.\\nFinding no error in the record, the trial court should be affirmed.\\nMallery and Rosellini, JJ., concur with Hunter, J.\""},{"id":838633,"name":"Downie v. City of Renton","opinion":"\"Millaed, J.\\n-This action was brought to enjoin the city of Renton from discharging waste water from its reservoir on to the plaintiff\u2019s land. Plaintiff, being unable to sustain the same, voluntarily dismissed his second cause of action to recover for loss of fish and damage to his fish pond by such drainage. As an affirmative defense, the city alleged that it had acquired by prescription the right to flow water from its reservoir over the plaintiff\u2019s land. The trial of the cause to the court resulted in judgment of dismissal. Plaintiff has appealed.\\nIn 1921, the appellant purchased, and has ever since owned and resided upon, three lots (comprising approximately two acres) lying to the south of the city of Renton and adjacent to the county road. A small, steady stream of pure water, fed from springs, runs through a gulch across this property from the southwest. In 1928, the appellant constructed upon this property, near the north boundary thereof, a concrete dam ninety feet long and eighteen feet high at the center. This created a pond covering approximately fifteen thousand square feet (a little more than one-sixth of the area of the two-acre tract of appellant), the water averaging ten to twelve feet in depth. The same year this dam was constructed, the appellant purchased twenty-five thousand small fish at a cost of one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and placed them in this pond. The appellant also maintained at this dam a wheel, which, except for the summer months, generated his electricity.\\nSince 1908, the city of Benton has maintained a reservoir as a part of its municipal water system. This reservoir is located adjacent to the said county road, and about twelve hundred feet to the south of appellant\u2019s two acres. It is of concrete, and has a capacity of five hundred thousand gallons. A pipe line ten inches in diameter leads from the bottom of the reservoir and runs a distance of about.six hundred feet in an easterly direction, emptying into a natural depression or gulch, then empties into a small stream, which is the identical stream mentioned as flowing across the property of the appellant. This pipe line is used for draining the reservoir.\\nIt has been the practice since construction of the reservoir in 1908 to semi-annually discharge the water through the city service pipes until the water level in the reservoir is three or four feet from the bottom, when the remainder is drained through the ten-inch drainage or wash-out pipe, the amount of water so discharged through the drainage pipe being about forty thousand gallons. Because of the contamination by the presence of the bacillus coli in the city water, algae on the side walls of the reservoir, and sediment in the tank, the water is drained off as above mentioned, the sediment removed by men with buckets, and, after the flushing out of the tank through the drainage pipe, the inside of the tank is whitewashed. The silt or dirt, brushed down from the sides and in the bottom of the reservoir, is carried in buckets over the top of the reservoir and deposited on to the respondent city\u2019s own property, and does not pass through the wash-out line. This process of draining occupies from two to two and one-half hours, the water so discharged reaching the property of appellant by gravity flow from the outlet of the drainage pipe.\\nThe testimony of respondent\u2019s witnesses was to the effect that the water discharged from the reservoir through the wash-out line at no time reached to the top of the wall of appellant\u2019s dam. Appellant testified that the sudden emptying of the water into the fish pond from the reservoir raised its level above the top of the dam, resulting in the fish being washed over the top of the dam and being killed. Appellant testified that his property was flooded three times: In May, 1928, a short time prior to placing the fish in the pond, and twice in September, 1929.\\n\u201cQ. You want to say there were three times, once in May, 1928 \u2014 A. On the 21st of May, 1928. Q. Yes. A. Just as soon as the wall was built and the dam was full of water, they washed the reservoir out. Q. And then again you say that the city flushed its reservoir in September? A. Yes, twice. Q. Twice? Tell the court those two dates in September, 1929, upon which you claim they flushed the reservoir? A. I can\u2019t tell you. It was in September.\u201d\\nBy letter of September 25,1928, the clerk of the city of Renton advised counsel for appellant that the city was making plans to fix this reservoir so that no water would come down into appellant\u2019s fish pond; that the city was planning to divert the water to another location.\\nOn September 10, 1929, respondent\u2019s water superintendent advised appellant by letter as follows:\\n\u201c. . . The water department of the city of Ren-ton is about to connect its new supply main with its reservoir on Talbot Hill. In order to do this it will be necessary to completely empty said reservoir and the water that is released will pass through your pond and over the spillway of your dam. While the reservoir is empty we will also clean and repair it. We will not release the water in such quantity as will cause you any damage, but will let it out gradually. We will probably begin to empty on September 12th and it will remain empty for three or four days.\\n\u201cWill you please cooperate with us to the extent that you lower your spillway gate to accommodate the excess water that will pass through?\u201d\\nNo water was drained from the reservoir at that time, as a temporary injunction was issued on application of the appellant on September 11, 1929, restraining the respondent from discharging water from the reservoir. From that date until the injunction was dissolved on September 20,1929, no effort was made to drain the reservoir. As soon as the injunction was dissolved, the water was discharged from the reservoir. Appellant testified that, at the particular time in September when the water came from the reservoir into the creek and down into his pond, he did not raise the bolt which lowers the spillway of the dam; that the wire at his house by which he always did raise the spillway was in some manner defective, and that he could not go over to the pond to raise the bolt. He testified:\\n\u201cYes, I tried to raise it from the house and I could not. I am lame and I could not, and I had to go over to the pond, to the wall before I could raise the holt. Q. If you could have raised it would that have prevented the overflow? A. From the house? Q. Yes. A. I suppose it would. Q. How is that operated, that holt, Mr. Downie? How do you raise it? A. With a wire. Q. And what was the reason you could not raise it at that time from the house? Is that the customary place you do that? A. No, only to get my lights. When I want to give the wheel water, then I pull the holt at the house, and up comes the light. . . . Q. And that particular day you didn\u2019t succeed in doing that? A. No. Q. Why? A. The bolt was stuck. It hadn\u2019t been used for a long time.\u201d\\nAppellant contends that the discharge of contaminated water semi-annually from the respondent\u2019s reservoir into the gulch, and thence into his fish pond, constitutes a violation of substantial rights in the use and enjoyment of property, entitling him to injunctive relief, though the resultant monetary damages suffered from such nuisance cannot be proved.\\nIn Mitchell Realty Co. v. City of West Allis, 184 Wis. 352, 199 N. W. 390, 35 A. L. R. 396, it was held that a municipal corporation is liable for injury to lower riparian owners for turning into a stream large quantities of water from its water works system and from artesian wells grossly charged with impurities, although it employs the natural course of drainage in so doing. Though the damages caused by flowing waters upon the lands of another be not considerable, equity will enjoin the continuance of such nuisance.\\n\u201cThe corporation is liable ... if, without authority of law, it collects surface or other waters in a public sewer, and empties them upon the land of an individual to his injury, either immediately or by force of gravitation.\u201d G-ould on Waters (3rd ed.), p. 530, \u00a7261.\\n\u201cIf any nuisance of this kind be shown, though causing inconsiderable damages, equity will enjoin its continuance . . . The inconvenience is one of the public\u2019s own creation, and should be borne by it rather than the individual.\u201d Id., p. 813, \u00a7 546.\\nRespondent insists that, having carried on this practice for at least twenty years, a prescriptive right has been acquired by it to dispose of the water from the reservoir in the manner herein set forth.\\nA prescriptive right acquired by one is determinative of a corresponding loss or forfeiture of right by another, and, as forfeitures are not favored, it is absolutely essential that all of the elements necessary to constitute a permanent valid claim by adverse user, amounting to a prescriptive right should be shown to be present.\\n\u201cThere are certain essential elements which enter into their composition, and which must be present before a right can be acquired by prescription. And as a prescriptive right, acquired by one person, is a corresponding loss or forefeiture of right by another, and, further, as the law does not favor forfeitures, it is absolutely essential that all the elements prescribed by law as necessary to constitute a permanent valid claim by adverse possession amounting to prescriptive right should be present.\u201d 2 Kinney on Irrigation and Water Rights (2d ed.), p. 1876, \u00a7 1048.\\nThat is to say, the respondent has no prescriptive easement, unless, for ten consecutive years, the drainage semi-annually of the reservoir and the resulting flowage of appellant\u2019s land were so open, notorious, and adverse to the interests of the appellant (and his predecessors in interest) that he was bound to take notice of that invasion and object to the continuance thereof, or become bound by the servitude this imposed upon his land. To acquire an easement by prescription the owner must know of and acquiesce in the adverse claim, or the use must be so open, notorious, visible, and uninterrupted that knowledge and acquiescence will be presumed. 9 R. C. L. 779; 19 C. J. 881.\\nA right to flow water over another\u2019s land may be acquired by prescription. Crumbaugh v. Mobile & O. R. Co., 105 Miss. 485, 62 South. 233.\\n\u201cDrainage rights may be acquired by prescription. The character of the usage of an easement which will ripen into a legal right by prescription is the same as is required to gain title to land by adverse possession. . . . The claim of right must be exercised with the knowledge of the owner of the servient estate, i. e., actual knowledge or a user on the part of the claimant of such character that knowledge will be presumed.\u201d Naporra v. Weckwerth, 178 Minn. 203, 226 N. W. 569.\\nThe case at bar is not one within the rule of claim of right by adverse possession to uncultivated, unoccupied, and wild lands. Murray v. Bousquet, 154 Wash. 42, 280 Pac. 935. The land through which the water from the reservoir flows is close to and in view of the county road. One of appellant\u2019s neighbors testified that he uses part of this water which is carried across his land for his barn, and he has lived there since 1913. The area of appellant\u2019s three lots is approximately two acres or eighty-seven thousand square feet. More than one-sixth of that area has been converted into a fish pond. His neighbor knew as early as 1913, and others testified they knew as far back as 1909, that the reservoir was drained semi-annually and the water discharged into the gulch, thence into the stream flowing across appellant\u2019s land.\\nThat the use was open and notorious is clear. Appellant has resided on the two acres since 1921. He did not complain until 1928 of the use of the gulch and creek by the respondent for drainage of its reservoir. Surely, on such a small tract of land, on which he resided for seven years, the appellant, could not fail to see, the presumption is conclusive that he did see, the water flowing through the gulch fourteen to sixteen times during that period.\\nWe do not agree with appellant that the semi-annual discharge of the water into the gulch was not such open, notorious, and continuous use as the law requires must be done in order to serve as a basis for an adverse claim of right. We are convinced that appellant had actual knowledge sometime subsequent to 1921, and prior to the construction of his dam in 1928, of respondent\u2019s use of the ditch. If such discharge of the water into that ditch resulted as appellant contends, of depositing a substantial amount of silt and dirt, the accumulation from 1908 to 1921, plus the added deposit subsequent to 1921, the gradual filling in of the gulch, apprised appellant of the use by respondent.\\nThe first complaint made of the water flowing over his land was made by the appellant to the respondent in August, 1928. Appellant testified that the city wrote and informed his counsel they would not route any more water over the pond; that no more water was thrown upon his land until the date he got the restraining order. It is clear from the testimony, however, that the appellant is mistaken. Doubtless the appellant is somewhat confused as to his dates. It is clear from the record that in September, 1929, when, appellant was advised that the reservoir would be cleaned, and request was made that he lower the spillway of his dam, an order was issued, on application of the appellant, restraining the city from discharging the water into the gulch; that no water was discharged from the reservoir into the gulch until the temporary restraining order was dissolved September 20, 1929.\\n- The use by respondent of the ditch was such as afforded reasonable indication of the claim. To constitute a prescriptive right to use of the ditch for flow-age of waste water from the reservoir, the acts of respondent must have been of such a nature and frequency as to give notice to appellant that the right was being claimed.\\n\u201cIt has been said that the correct rule, as to continuity of use to give a prescriptive right to an easement and what shall constitute such continuity, can be stated only with reference to the nature and character of the right claimed. However, in order that user may be considered continuous, it is not necessary that it should be constant. Ordinarily, if whenever the claimant needs it from time to time he makes use of it, and the acts constituting the user are of such frequency as to give notice to the landowner of the rights claimed against him, the nser will be considered continuous. And a fortiori a temporary nonuser by agreement of the parties is not fatal. Nevertheless there must be such repeated acts of such character and at such intervals as afford a sufficient indication to the owner that an easement is claimed; . . . \u201d 19 C. J. 882.\\nSee, also,\\n\u201cBy exclusive, the law does not mean that the right of way must be used by one person only, because two or more persons may be entitled to the use of the same way, but simply that the right should not depend for its enjoyment upon a similar right in others, and that the party claiming it exercises it under some claim existing in his favor independent of all others. It must be exclusive as against the right of the community at large.\\n\u201cNor does the law mean by \u2018an uninterrupted and continuous enjoyment,\u2019 that a person shall use the way every day for twenty years, but simply that he exercises the right more or less frequently, according to the nature of the use to which its enjoyment may be applied, and without objection on the part of the owner of the land, and under such circumstances as excludes the presumption of a voluntary abandonment on the part of the person claiming it.\u201d Cox v. Forrest, 60 Md. 74.\\n\u201cThe claimant is required to make such reasonable use of the way as his needs require. So it is of the ditch. If, whenever the claimant needs it, from time to time, he makes use of it, this is a continuous use. An omission to use when not needed does not disprove a continuity of use, shown by using it when needed (Bodfish v. Bodfish, 105 Mass. 317). Neither such intermission nor omission breaks the continuity.\u201d Hesperia Land & Water Co. v. Rogers, 83 Cal. 10, 23 Pac. 196.\\nPrior to September, 1929, there was no affirmative act on the part of appellant contesting the right of respondent to use the ditch for the drainage of its reservoir. Prior to appellant\u2019s moving upon the property in 1921, the prescriptive right of respondent to so use the ditch had been acquired. (Por more than ten years prior to 1921, the ditch was continuously used by respondent.)\\nA letter from the city clerk in the year 1928, advising counsel for appellant of the city\u2019s plan to divert the water to another location, and the letter of respondent of September, 1929, requesting cooperation on the part of appellant to prevent the flooding of his pond, are not such acts on the part of respondent as will defeat its prescriptive right. The respondent\u2019s title had vested prior to that time; therefore, conceding respondent requested permission in 1929 to flow the land, such act would not have defeated the prescriptive right of the respondent. The rule is stated as follows:\\n\u201cIt is elementary that where the title has become fully vested by disseizin so long continued as to bar an action, it can not be divested by parol abandonment or relinquishment or by verbal declarations of the disseizor, nor by any other act short of what would be required in a case where his title was by deed. School District v. Benson, 31 Me. 381. We therefore conclude that from any point of view, whether a lease was made or not is not a material matter.\u201d Towles v. Hamilton, 94 Neb. 588, 143 N. W. 935.\\n\u201cThe presumption of a grant is rebutted if the person prescribing for the easement acknowledges the right of the owner within twenty years, though he does it under a mistake of his own rights. So the asking leave to exercise the right from time to time within the period of prescription breaks the continuity of the enjoyment as of right, inasmuch as each asking of leave is an admission that, at that time, the person so asking had no title; but the right, when fully established by adverse use, is not lost by asking and receiving a license from the original owner, although this may, in case of doubt, be strong evidence that the previous user was not under a claim of right.\u201d Gould on Waters (3d ed.), p. 641, \u00a7339.\\n\u201cWhere title has become perfect by adverse possession for the statutory period it is not lost by an admission of the holder that the possession was not adverse, . . .\u201d 2 C. J. 256.\\nSee, also, McInnis v. Day Lumber Co., 102 Wash. 38, 172 Pac. 844.\\nThe appellant had actual knowledge shortly subsequent to 1921 of the use by respondent of the ditch, and did nothing to prevent respondent from its continuous enjoyment of the right claimed by it. The use by the respondent of that ditch has been open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted, and adverse to the appellant and his predecessors in interest since 1908.\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nMitchell, Holcomb, and Fullerton, JJ., \u201cconcur.\\nBeals, J., dissents.\""},{"id":782330,"name":"DeHoney v. Gjarde","opinion":"\"Fullerton, J.\\nOn April 5, 1922, J. H. DeHoney and wife entered into a contract with Peder P. Gjarde, by the terms of which Gjarde agreed to erect for the DeHoneys a building on a described tract of land, in the city of Seattle, to be used as a dancing academy. The contract provided that Gjarde should furnish all the necessary labor and materials and erect the building according to plans and specifications agreed upon between the parties,- prepared by one Svarz as architect. The contract price was $27,329, and the building was to be completed on or before 110 days from tbe date of tbe contract. Gjarde entered at once upon tbe performance of tbe work, completed it witbin tbe time fixed by tbe contract, and was paid tbe contract price.\\nDeHoney and wife took possession of tbe building sometime in August, 1923, and began to use it for tbe purposes for wbicb it was constructed. Tbe building gave no trouble during tbe dry weather wbicb followed tbe time possession was taken, but in tbe latter part of October, when tbe. rainy season began, water came into tbe ball of tbe building used for dancing in considerable quantities; so considerable, in fact, as to damage tbe furnishings and to cause tbe dancing floor to swell and buckle. The DeHoneys conceived that tbe water came into tbe room because of a defective and leaking roof, and called upon Gjarde to repair it. Some correspondence passed between them, resulting in a denial on tbe part of Gjarde of liability. Tbe DeHoneys caused tbe roof to be repaired by another person, and caused some additional ventilation to be installed in tbe building, whereupon water ceased to come into the room, and the walls thereof became dry soon thereafter.\\nTbe DeHoneys, as plaintiffs, thereafter began tbe present action to recover against Gjarde and bis bondsman, tbe Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland, in damages for tbe injuries caused by tbe water. They alleged that Gjarde failed to construct tbe building in accordance with tbe plans and specifications, in that be \u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to turn up tbe felt and flashings onto the walls of said building not less than 18 inches as tbe contract and good workmanship required, but instead turned tbe same up not to exceed 12 inches in any place, and around tbe greater portion of tbe walls, not to exceed four inches, and negligently and carelessly failed to put tbe same up tight against said walls or to nail or otherwise fasten or cement the same at sufficiently close intervals, so that as a result the upper portions of the same were allowed to be loose and to bulge out from said walls, so that water could go- through where the same should have been fastened tight to the walls and from thence go down under the roofing and thence into the building; that where there were columns erected just inside said side walls, making numerous angles, the said felt and flashings were in some places pressed in so hard by them as to have cracked and broken the same, leaving openings for the water to go through, while in other places, they negligently and carelessly failed to press the same into- the angles sufficiently, but on the contrary allowed the same-to be loose and to bulge out at the top where it should have been tightly joined to the wall, so that the water could run down into the building as hereinbefore mentioned; that they negligently and carelessly allowed approximately 100 holes and openings to be and remain where the water could leak through, said holes and openings, for the most part being located where said felt and flashings should have been joined tight to the wall and columns, and where the same had been broken as hereinbefore mentioned, which were thereupon hidden by them by placing the counter flashings so as to conceal the same; that the top of said counter flashings was fastened by them to a wooden strip set in the concrete wall; that they negligently placed around said wooden strip certain plaster which was made out of poor material in that there was too much sand in the same, so that the same was so porous that it allowed the water to run through the same and back of said counter flashings and that much of said plastering material fell out after the same became water soaked; that the felt and flash-ings around the ventilators were not properly fastened by them, as hereinbefore stated, so- that the same were loose and bulged at the top, allowing the water to leak in; that the paper used by them on the slopes where the roof slopes steeply from the upper portion of the roof to the 'valley\u2019 portion of the roof below, was of poor quality, in that the same was checked and cracked; that the paper used by them on the roof and slopes was so put together by them that the same would leak at the joints and seams, the cause thereof not being known to plaintiffs; that along the south side of said building there were leaks under the windows; that they wholly failed to place any galvanized iron boxes in the comers, surrounding the drain pipes, but instead placed boxes made of cheap tin, none of which were securely soldered, so that the water leaked out of them, instead of going into the pipes; that no screens were placed in said boxes until after the first rains hereinafter mentioned, and on approximately the 17th day of November, 1923, thus allowing said pipes to become clogged; that by reason of the matters herein-above set forth, said building, when turned over to the plaintiffs on or about Aug. 29,1922, did not have a roof capable of turning water during an ordinary rain, but on the contrary said roof was in such condition as to be leaky in wet weather, none of which defects were discovered by plaintiffs or known to them until the rains hereinafter mentioned occurred.\u201d\\nDamages were claimed in the following sums for the following items:\\nRepairing roof ........................... $541.35\\nCarpenter work .......................... 400.30\\nRedecorating the walls and work on damaged paintings ............................. 403.65\\nPlumbing work........................... 25.47\\nTinning.................................. 5.25\\nResurfacing the dancing floor.............. 600.00\\nRedecorating the walls and ceiling.......... 1,500.00\\nAdditional work on paintings.............. 600.00\\nDamage to seats.......................... 800.00\\nDamage to piano...................\u2022...... 500.00\\nDamage to curtains....................... 300.00\\nDepreciation of building (Not repairable).. .10,000.00\\nLoss of profits because of non-usability of building ..............................25,000.00\\nThe first five of the items of damage were for money actually expended for the work therein indicated. Other items, in so far as they relate to work, were the estimates of witnesses of the reasonable cost of performance. The remaining items are self-explanatory. After issue had been joined on the complaint, a trial was entered upon before a jury. During the course of the trial the court withdrew from the consideration of the jury the item of damage relating to loss of profits. The jury, on the remaining items, returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $14,500.25. Within due time, the defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but entered an order to the effect that it would grant the motion for a new trial unless within twenty days thereafter the plaintiffs would in writing remit from the amount of the verdict the sum of $10,000; further ordering that, in case such remission be made, the plaintiffs have judgment for the amount of the remainder of the verdict. The remission was filed within the required time, and thereupon judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $4,500.25.\\nThe plaintiffs also moved for a new trial on the question of damages for loss of profits, which motion the court denied. Both parties appeal; the defendants from the judgment entered, and the plaintiffs from the order of the court refusing them a new trial on the question of the loss of profits.\\nTaking up the appeal of the defendants, they first assign error on the ruling of the court denying them a new trial. Under this head they present a number of questions, the first being that the verdict was the result of passion and prejudice on the part of the jury. It is said that this is evidenced (1) by the amount of the verdict, (2) because the verdict is contrary to the evidence, and (3) because the trial court so found. Noticing these in their order, of the first it can be said that the verdict was well within the testimony introduced on the part of the plaintiffs. The total sum claimed by the plaintiffs, and which their evidence tended to prove, omitting the claim of $25,000 for loss of profits which the court took from the jury, was $15,676.02. The general verdict of the jury was for $14,500.25. Manifestly, it seems to- us this is not so close an approximation to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to furnish conclusive proofs that the jury gave the evidence no consideration, but followed blindly the plaintiffs \u2019 testimony.\\nNor did the question of the amount of damages suffered rest upon the testimony of the plaintiffs alone. They were supported by competent disinterested witnesses, some of whom had made estimates with a view of repairing the damages. Nor was the item of depreciation without evidence in its support. In addition to the estimates, a witness who had been engaged in building construction for twenty-three years testified that in his judgment the building was depreciated in value by the flooding to which it had been subjected in the sum of $10,000. The amount of the depreciation is, of course, of no moment on the present appeal, since the plaintiffs consented to waive their claim thereto rather than submit to a new trial. It is mentioned to repel the inference which might otherwise be thought to obtain, that the jury returned a verdict for a claim unsupported by evidence. True, there are affidavits of certain jurors to the effect that some of the items of damage were allowed in full and others disallowed, but conceding that jurors may thus explain their verdict after their discharge, there is nothing in the fact which so far impeaches it as to require the court to say that it was the result of passion and prejudice. Moreover, we do not find' in the record that the estimates of the plaintiffs \u2019 witnesses were disputed by the other side. There was a leakage from the roof at one time for which the defendants admitted fault, and they offered testimony to the effect that the damage caused thereby did not exceed $50, but on the general question of the amount of damages, the cause went to the jury on the testimony of the plaintiffs \u2019 witnesses. It would seem that, under these circumstances, the court could hardly find either passion or prejudice had the verdict been for the full amount demanded.\\nThe second contention under this head is that the overwhelming weight of the evidence relating to the cause of the damage is against the verdict of the jury. It is first argued that the building was constructed according to the plans and specifications, and if it was so constructed as not to furnish protection against leaks in the roof, it was the fault of the plaintiffs who furnished the plans and specifications, and not the fault of the builder. To an understanding of this argument some notice must be taken of the plans and specifications. The building was in size 72 feet by 128 feet. It was a one-story building with the ceiling 18 feet above the floor. The walls were of six-inch reinforced concrete. The roof was for the greater part comparatively flat, breaking down at rather a sharp angle as the walls were approached, forming a valley or gutter along the walls. The frame work was of wood construction covered over with sheathing hoards. Over the sheathing boards was laid a dry sheet of felt, and over this four layers of felt glued together with roofing cement. On top of this was poured a coating of asphalt onto which gravel was spread. The construction of the slopes was the same as the main part of the roof, except that the gravel was omitted and in its stead was placed an additional thickness of 3-ply Lastile roofing, called a finishing sheet. The plans required the felt to reach across the valley formed by the junction of the roof and the wall, and to extend up the wall for a distance of 18 inches. This extension is called in the record the base-flashing. It was to be well pressed into angles of the wall, reinforced with a strip of felt eight inches wide, cemented solidly in place, and covered by a counter-flashing \u2014 a strip of galvanized iron fastened into the wall and bent over the base-flashing. The counter-flashing was fastened to a reglet placed in the wall at the time the concrete was poured. The valleys or gutters were constructed with a slope or pitch towards the comers of the building wherein were placed outlet boxes with pipes leading to the city sewers, furnishing an escape for water falling on the roof.\\nBy some miscalculation the reglets were not placed high enough in the walls of the building to permit the base-flashing to extend up the walls for the distance called for by the plans and specifications \u2014 the actual distance, instead of being eighteen inches as the plans required, was twelve inches at the highest place, ranging from that distance down to four inches at the lowest. It was the testimony of plaintiffs and their witnesses that the base-flashings were not cemented to the wall and that water falling on the roof and flowing into the valley would rise higher than the base-flashing, pass under the counter-flashing and flow down between the base-flashing and the wall of the building and come out into the main dancing hall. The evidence on the part of the defendants, on the other hand, was to the effect that there was no leaking in this manner, that the water that was found in the dancing room was the result of condensation, caused by the crowds that gathered in the room and insufficient ventilation. The evidence on these discordant views it would serve no useful purpose to review. As we read the record, the evidence preponderates on the side of the plaintiffs. At the least, there was substantial evidence supporting the view of the plaintiffs sufficient to warrant the jury in so finding without subjecting them to the charge of being controlled by the undue influence of passion and prejudice.\\nThe third ground assigned for the conclusion that the jury were influenced by passion and prejudice in rendering their verdict, we think, is also without foundation. The matter arose out of the argument of one of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to the jury. It appears in the record by affidavits filed by the defendants in support of their motion for a new trial, and opposing affidavits by the other side, no stenographic report of the argument being taken. In the defendants\u2019 affidavits counsel for the plaintiffs is accused of stating to the jury that the court in its rulings and conduct unduly favored the defendants; the more precise charge being that counsel stated to the jury that in his cross examination of one of the defendants\u2019 witnesses he had the witness \u201ccornered,\u201d and that the court came to his relief by calling a recess, giving the witness an opportunity to collect his thoughts. In the opposing affidavits it is admitted that counsel said something in the nature of the remark cited to* the jury, but he denies that his language was capable of the interpretation put upon it by the defendants, that he expressly disclaimed at the time that he was charging the court with unfairness, and stated expressly that the recess was called because the usual time therefor had arrived. * In passing upon the motion for a new trial, the court stated that he thought the remark was very unfortunate, and that it \u201cmust have had some effect upon the jury\u201d; further stating that ordinarily remarks of this sort \u201creact on the person making the remark, but it is evident in this case it did not, in view of the verdict that was returned.\u201d\\nIt is from these statements of the court that the defendants draw the conclusion that the court found that the jury\u2019s verdict was the result of passion and prejudice. But we cannot draw therefrom a like conclusion. The court\u2019s very ruling on the motion is conclusive to the contrary. The trial judge is distinguished and experienced. He has long presided on the trial bench, and it is unthinkable that his sense of justice would permit him to let the verdict stand if he was of the belief that it was founded on something other than the evidence in the cause. It is our feeling that much is here made of little. At the time of the argument, the remark was not regarded as of sufficient moment to require notice either by the trial judge or by the opposing counsel. Manifestly, if it was then thought that it contained the sinister charge now imputed to it, it would not have gone unchallenged.\\nIt is further argued in this connection that the remarks imputed to counsel require a reversal in any event, regardless of the question of passion or prejudice. But we think we need not pursue the inquiry further than to add that in this aspect it is not sufficiently before the court for review. No objection to the remark was made at the time of its utterance. The rule is that improper argument of counsel cannot be successfully assigned as error unless there has been a request to the court to correct it by instructing the jury to disregard it, or unless the misconduct is so flagrant as to be incapable of cure by instruction. Canfield v. Seattle Cornice Works, 122 Wash. 318, 210 Pac. 773; Vanderveer v. Hillman, 122 Wash. 684, 211 Pac. 722. In our view, there was nothing in the remark here incapable of cure by instructions.\\nThe next contention is that, if the damage to the building was the fault of a leaking roof, it was due to defects in the design of the building and not due to the fault of the contractor. To an understanding of the objection some further description of the manner in which the roof was constructed is necessary. Where the roof supports joined the wall of the building, a valley was left by the mode of construction required of some eight or nine inches wide only. The plans required a galvanized iron drain box twelve inches wide to be inserted in the valley to facilitate the flow of water to the outlet pipes located at the comers of the building, and further required that the drain should have a slope. A drain box twelve inches wide would not thus rest on the top of the supporting beams, or closer thereto than some four or more inches. In making the measurements for the insertion in the wall of the reglets at the time of its construction, no allowance was made either for this elevation or for the slope of the box, and apparently there were other things which raised the bottom of the valley for which no allowance was made. As the position of the reglets measured the height of the base-flashings, the result was that the flashings did not extend eighteen inches above the bottom of the valley.\\nIt is claimed that the scale drawings of the architect showing the position in the wall at which the reglets were to be inserted made no allowance for these differences, and that there was thus a conflict between the plans and specifications and the scale drawings, and that the builder was justified in following the scale drawings. It is further contended that the architect, who was empowered by the building contract to reconcile conflicts that might exist between the plans, specifications and drawings, had his attention called to this discrepancy at the time it was discovered, and that he not only approved the work at that time, but also subsequently accepted the completed work as a compliance with the contract. But we cannot accept these conclusions. As we view the drawings, it required some rather delicate measurements to determine the position of the reglets in the wall from the drawings alone, and that error could easily occur by relying upon such measurements. But the rule is that plans, specifications and drawings for a building must be construed as a whole, and plainly, nothing more than a casual examination of the whole would at once disclose that measurements from the top of the roof beams would not permit the insertion of the base-flash-ings to the height required by the plans and specifications. Nor do we think that the approval of the architect bound the owners. At the time of the acceptance and final payment, they were ignorant of this failure to follow the plans and specifications, and we find this clause in the contract:\\n\u201cNo payments or certificate, final or otherwise, shall be construed to relieve the contractor from his obligation to make good any defects arising or discovered in his work within six months after the completion and acceptance of the same.\u201d\\nThe discovery of the defect was made within the six months\u2019 period, and within that time a demand was made upon the builder to repair it, with which demand there was no compliance.\\nThe specifications provided:\\n\u201cThe roofing contractor shall give a satisfactory written guarantee on the roof, guaranteeing same for the period of ten years against leaks, and keeping the same in repair during the ten years.\u201d\\nAs a compliance with this clause of the specifications the builder procured a letter from the corporation to whom he had let a subcontract for installing the roof, in which the subcontractor agreed to maintain the roofing installed by them for a period of ten years. The recited conditions were:\\n\u201cThis agreement relates only to the material and workmanship furnished by us, and will be fulfilled by repairing free of charge any leaks resulting\u2019 from defects in such material or workmanship. This maintenance agreement is issued to Peder P. Gjarde of Seattle, Wash., and refers to approximately lOb^ squares of roofing completed on the 5th day of June, 1922, on a building located on Lot 12 and south 20 feet of Lot 11, Block 11, Nagles Addition to the City of Seattle, known as the DeHoney Dancing Academy building.\u201d\\nThis letter was forwarded to the plaintiffs and retained by them. The defendants requested the court to charge the jury that the \u201cletter constituted a sufficient and satisfactory guarantee and complied with the terms of the specifications,\u201d and that \u201cthe liability of the defendants in this case is limited to the fair and reasonable costs in putting the roof in satisfactory condition, if you find that it was leaky or defective, . . . and you cannot award\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cdamages for any injuries to their building, its floors, walls or contents.\u201d The court declined to give the instruction and error is assigned thereon. Were this an action based upon the special warranty set forth, possibly the rule for which the defendants contend might be applicable. But this is not such an action. It is an action based upon the building contract as an entirety, of which this warranty is only a part. The question is not, therefore, was there a breach of the warranty, but is rather, was there a breach of the building contract. In such an action the measure of damages is the amount of damages which naturally result or flow from the breach complained of, and which were contemplated by the parties as a probable consequence of the breach. School District No. 172 v. Josenhans, 88 Wash. 624, 153 Pac. 326. There can, we think, be no question that a breach of that part of the contract relating to the construction of the roof, if the breach was of such a nature as to cause it to leak water in quantities such as was shown here, would materially damage the interior of the building as well as the contents of the building. There can, therefore, be a recovery of the damages ensuing from the breach, re.gardless of the terms of the special contract to keep the roof in repair.\\nThe sixth assignment of error relates to the evidence introduced to show a loss of profits. It will be remembered that the court, during the course of the trial, withdrew this item of damage from the consideration of the jury and instructed the jury not to consider the evidence relating thereto. At this stage of the proceedings the plaintiffs had introduced a considerable part of their evidence on the subject, and it is contended that, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the item from the consideration of the jury and the instruction given, the prejudicial effect of the evidence was not thereby cured. But we see nothing unusual in this circumstance. In the trial of causes it frequently happens that the court must, from the nature of the case, admit evidence on subjects which he must afterwards withdraw from the consideration of the jury, aud if this must in every case require the trial court to discharge the jury then empaneled and commence over again, \u201cthere will,\u201d as we said in Bayers v. Barry, 114 Wash. 252, 194 Pac. 993, \u201cbe no end to law suits.\u201d But the rule is not thus stringent. In the early case of Lyts v. Keevey, 5 Wash. 606, 32 Pac. 534, we said we were not disposed to adopt the rule that evidence improperly admitted cannot be counteracted in the subsequent course of the trial by instructions withdrawing its consideration from the jury. This rule we have followed in many subsequent cases. See: Wilson v. West & Slade Mill Co., 28 Wash. 312, 68 Pac. 716; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075; Billings v. Snohomish, 51 Wash. 135, 98 Pac. 107; and the cases collected in the cited cases.\\nIn State v. Gay, 82 Wash. 423, 144 Pac. 711, concerning this question, we said:\\n\u201cBut it is contended that the evidence was so far prejudicial as to be incapable of cure by its withdrawal from.the consideration of the jury. To this point, the appellant cites State v. Pryor, 67 Wash. 216, 121 Pac. 56. That case, however, was an extreme case. The evidence admitted and subsequently withdrawn had reference to offenses degrading in their nature, in no way connected with the offense upon which the appellant was being prosecuted, and was withdrawn only on condition that the defendant would admit a fact necessary to be shown in order to convict him of the offense with which he was charged. Under these circumstances, the court could well conclude that the act of the court did not remove the prejudice occasioned by the admission of the improper evidence. But it was not 'therein intended to be held that no error in the admission of improper testimony can be cured by such means, and especially was it not meant to be held that evidence, not objectionable in itself, but improperly admitted because of a circumstance not shown when the testimony was offered, cannot be cured by withdrawing it from the consideration of the jury. The presumption in all cases is that the jury obeyed the instructions of the court, and this presumption must prevail until it is overcome by some showing that the fact is otherwise. To withdraw evidence subsequently discovered to be improperly admitted is a common practice in criminal as well as in civil causes, and the procedure is generally held to cure any error caused by its improper admission. State v. Manville, 8 Wash. 523, 36 Pac. 470; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075. We think in the present case any error committed by the admission of the testimony objected to was cured by its subsequent withdrawal.\u201d\\nThis court has held, it is true, in cases other than the case referred to in the last cited case, that, there are circumstances where the prejudicial effect of improper evidence is not removed by instructions to disregard it, but it will be found from an examination of the cases that they present circumstances differentiating them from the general rule, matters not present in the case now before us.\\nThe account book of the plaintiffs showing their receipts and disbursements in the operation of the building prior to and during the time the leakage from the roof occurred, was admitted in evidence as tending to prove loss of profits. When this item of damage was withdrawn from the jury the book as evidence was also stricken. By some inadvertence, however, it was sent to the jury room along with the exhibits in the cause. The affidavits of the jurors submitted show that the book was not examined by the jurors until after they had agreed upon a verdict, when some member of the jury read certain items therefrom. As the book related to matters which the court had instructed them were not for their consideration, it is difficult to see wherein it could have a prejudicial effect even-had it been examined by the jury. But conceding that prejudice under that circumstance might he presumed, the fact shown precludes error. The rule is thus stated in Thompson on Trials, \u00a7 2590:\\n\u201cIf the paper was taken out by mistake, and not by the fraud or design of the prevailing party, or his counsel, and if it was not in fact read by the jury, then there is no occasion to grant a new trial; since no harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered, and the other party has done no wrong for which he is to be punished. And the rule is the same where it is made to appear that the only jurors who read the objectionable paper had already agreed to return the verdict which was rendered. As the affidavits of jurors are generally admissible to sustain their verdicts, it may be shown by such evidence that the paper was not in fact read by any of the jury.\u201d\\n\u25a0 Here the book went to the jury by mistake, and not by fraud or design of the prevailing parties or their counsel. Nor was it considered by the jury. Hence, in the language of the authority cited, \u201cno harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered. \u2019 \u2019\\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 witness Kubat was permitted, over the objection of the defendants, to testify to the damage to a piano in the building caused by moisture. The objection was based on the ground that he had not shown sufficient qualifications. Frbm his testimony it appears that he had had twenty years\u2019 experience as a piano tuner, that he had been in the wholesale and retail trade of pianos for fifteen years, that he was familiar with prices of pianos in Seattle, and had done much work on the piano in question. At the time he was testifying he could not recall the make of the piano, but testified that it was a baby grand, a brand new instrument, and that the damage was to the strings, the pads, and the sounding board; the latter injury causing the principal damage. In our opinion, he was qualified to testify. The weight to be given to his testimony was, of course, for the jury, but its admission neither requires a reversal nor the deduction of this item of damage from the amount of the verdict.\\nCertain witnesses were called by the plaintiffs on rebuttal, and it is objected that their testimony is not proper rebuttal. These objections we shall not notice in detail, as we can see no such prejudice as would require a reversal, even were the objections well taken. But, more than this, we cannot conclude that the objections are well taken.\\nThe remaining assignments relate to the instructions of the court to the jury. There were requests for instructions which the trial court refused to give, and there were instructions to which the defendants excepted. In the main, they involve the question of the proper construction of the contract. These in part we have hereinbefore adverted, in which we have declined to follow the construction of the defendants, and have followed that of the trial court. These require no further discussion. Those not heretofore involved will be briefly noticed. The defendants requested the following instruction:\\n\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde.\u201d\\nThe court, on the subject-matter, gave the following:\\n\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde', in so far as the quality of the materials-and workmanship were concerned, but not as to any material deviation from the plans and specifications.\\n\u201cYou are instructed that it is provided in said contract and specifications that no alterations shall be made in the work shown or described by drawings and specifications, except upon the written order of the architect; that no deviation from the drawings or specifications shall be made in the execution of the work without the written approval of the architect; that no verbal statement of any person whomsoever shall be allowed in any manner or degree to modify or otherwise affect the terms of the contract of specifications, and that changes shall be made only and strictly according to contract.\u201d\\nIn its instructions the court but followed the provisions of the contract. There was elsewhere in the contract, it is true, recitals to the effect that the architect was the agent of the owner, and that his interpretation of the contract should be final, but these provisions referred to instances of repugnant provisions of the contract, or to instances where the contract did not speak; it gave the architect no- power to- modify provisions capable of but one interpretation. As we said in Dyer v. Middle Kittitas Irr. Dist., 40 Wash. 238, 82 Pac. 301:\\n\u201cThe contract provides that the engineer shall define the meaning, intent, and purport of the plans and specifications, and that his decision in all cases shall be final; but this, it is plain, refers to the interpretation of doubtful and uncertain terms of the contract, not to the question of law presented by the language of the contract or specifications. This clause does not confer upon the engineer the power to vary the meaning of plain terms used in the contract, for if this were so, there would be no need of the writing, as the engineer\u2019s arbitrary assertion would be all-sufficient.\u201d\\nSee, also: Hurley v. Kiona-Benton School Dist., No. 27, 124 Wash. 537, 215 Pac. 21; Mercantile Trust Co. v. Hensey, 205 U. S. 298.\\nThe trial court further on in its instructions quoted certain of the provisions of the contract relating to the manner of constructing the roof, and instructed the jury that even though they should find that the defendant Grjarde had the roofing work done by a subcontractor, he would nevertheless be under obligation to see that there was no deviation from the contract. The defendant objects to this for the reason that it amounted to an instruction that the defendant was obligated \u201cto see that the base flashing was turned up 18 inches, which was the pivot of the whole case.\u201d \u2022 In our opinion, the instruction was correct, even though it be so construed. As we have before indicated, the fact being admitted that there was not a compliance with the contract with reference to the construction of the roof in the respect stated, it followed as matter of law that there was a breach of the contract, for which the defendant was liable in damages for the injury that arose from the breach. Error, therefore, cannot be predicated on an instruction so stating.\\nTurning to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we find no error in the ruling of the court withdrawing from the consideration of the jury the question of loss of profits. True, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 102 Wash. 423, 172 Pac. 47; Brinnon Logging Co. v. Carlsborg M. & T. Co., 122 Wash. 483, 210 Pac. 945; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, 123 Wash. 139, 212 Pac. 156.\\nThe cases cited and the cases referred to in the citations illustrate the rule as we have applied it, and the principle involved requires no further elucidation. The evidence introduced shows that any verdict rendered thereon must, as to its amount, be speculative and conjectural, and we conclude that it was properly withdrawn from the consideration of the jury.\\nOur conclusion is that the judgment must be affirmed on both appeals, and it is so ordered. Neither appellant will recover costs in this court.\\nHolcomb, Main, Mitchell, and Mackintosh, JJ., concur.\""}]
